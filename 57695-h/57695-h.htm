<div>NOTE</div>

<p id="p000-ivp">There are various ways of spelling some of the
place-names of the South Sea Islands, <i>e.g.</i>
Samari, Tupusuli, and Elevera are so spelt in
this book, but the forms Samarai, Tupuselei,
and Ela-Vara are commonly met with. Ambryn,
however, is a misprint for Ambrym.</p>

<h3 class="h3herein">CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="psynopsis">Chiefly historical—Concerning certain discoverers, their aims
and ambitions—The story of New Guinea, the Solomons,
and New Hebrides, and some things that might be altered.</p>

<p class="pfirst">In
these days when distance hardly counts, when
the cry is heard that new outlets are wanted for
capital, when there are thousands of unemployed
crowded in London, and people are anxious to
find adventure, eager to see new things, to conquer
new lands, exploit new industries and gain more
knowledge, it is worth while turning our attention
to the South Sea Islands.</p>

<p>It is strange that so little is known of them,
and that so few people have bothered themselves
to visit them. A few missionaries, explorers, and
adventurers have written about and spent a few
months on them, but what is this when there are
miles and miles of the most beautiful country crying
out for people; there is wealth, both mineral and
vegetable, waiting for the
industry and enterprise <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span>
of good men to reap, and, above all, there is a
delightful climate and a race of savages who in
themselves repay the inconveniences of the journey.</p>

<p>The chief island is New Guinea, which is the
largest in the world and contains some 340,700
square miles, much of which has never been trodden
by white men. There are no sandy, dried-up districts
in New Guinea or the Solomon Islands, and
no long droughts; but rather a full fall of rain
which makes the ground bring forth its produce in
abundance.</p>

<p>There is land out there which some day will
surprise people, and when one considers the difficulty
Australia had to persuade the British Government
to annex it, one cannot help laughing at the
ignorance and short-sightedness of the men of those
times. It was not until 1884 that the Government
sent Commodore Erskine to the south-eastern
portion of New Guinea to proclaim a protectorate
over it, and then only after receiving a guarantee
from the Queensland Government that they would
undertake to find £15,000 per annum towards the
cost of its administration.</p>

<p>The Queensland Government had, a year before
this, already annexed it. They knew its value, and
had it not been for their
prompt action these <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span>
valuable islands would now all have been in the
possession of the Dutch and Germans.</p>

<p>Accounts of the islands date back to 1512, but
many things go to suggest that both the Malays and
Chinese knew of their existence and had visited
them long before that date. The first Europeans
we hear of who sighted them were the Spanish
sailor, Alvaro de Sacedra, and a Portuguese whose
name is not known.</p>

<p>Prior to the arrival of Captain Cook, in 1770,
there were numerous adventurers who gave accounts
of these islands. Luis Vaez de Torres, after whom
the Torres Straits were named, passed them in 1660
and sent to the world a full account of his voyage,
but little notice was taken of it. We next hear of
De Bougainville, the French navigator who arrived
there in 1768; then came Captain Cook, and after
him many others sighted the shores of New Guinea.</p>

<p>It was, however, the Dutch who first made any
movements to attempt to find out its geographic
and scientific value. They began in a neat business-like
way by annexing that section west of the 141st
meridian of east longitude, and despatching the
<i>Dourga</i>, commanded by Lieutenant Kolff, to examine
and report on it. He was a zealous man and,
like many other enthusiastic sailors
who have visited <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
new lands, found many things there which no one
else has been able to find, and which have since been
proved never to have existed. But some excuse for
him can be found, owing to the disadvantages he
was under and the savageness of the natives. He
probably thought that no one in his time, if they
followed him, would live to tell the tale, so he
wrote what he thought “might have been.” Then
came the Postillion Expedition in 1853, followed
by the Trinton Expedition and the Scientific
Expedition of Van der Crab in 1871. Dr. Meyers
followed in 1873, and many other Dutch enthusiasts
came after him during the next few years.</p>

<p>During this time, however, England was not
quite asleep. In 1842 H.M.S. <i>Fly</i> was sent on a
survey expedition and remained there till 1846,
attention being devoted to that part of the island
now known as British New Guinea. The Expedition
also discovered and named the rivers Fly
and Aird, in districts where later on many brave
and good men lost their lives at the hands of the
natives.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>Following this ship, in 1846, came H.M.S. <i>Rattlesnake</i>,
and good work was the result of her stay.
Captain Moresby visited the island in 1871, and
thoroughly explored many parts of
it which were <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span>
unknown before his time. He landed at the
harbour now known as Port Moresby, and gave
such glowing accounts of the island that it was
visited by many eminent naturalists immediately
afterwards; and then the work of the pioneer
missionaries, who had been busy there for some
time, began to be talked about, and considerable
interest in these islands was aroused.</p>

<p>Queensland, acting under the advice of Mr.
Chester, a prominent man well up in the value of
New Guinea, sent out Sir Thomas M‘Ilwraith to
take possession of it in the name of the Queen.
But the British Government refused to acknowledge
this act, and thereby aroused the indignation
of the Australians. A conference was held in
Sydney and the British Government communicated
with, with the result stated, that they saw their
mistake and Sir Peter Scratchley was sent to New
Guinea to act as High Commissioner.</p>

<p>His term of office was short, as he contracted
malaria in 1885 and died. The man who took his
place was a Queenslander, the Hon. John Douglas,
who understood the position, and did valuable
service to his country by making a study of the
natives and the possibilities of the country.</p>

<p>In 1888 Sir
William MacGregor, M.D., <span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span>
K.C.M.G., was finally appointed Governor, and
during his ten years of office showed that he was
the right man in the right place. He was succeeded
by George Ruthven Le Hunte, Esq., C.M.G.</p>

<p>To-day the affairs of British New Guinea are on
an excellent basis. An Administrator is appointed
by the Crown, whose duty it is to consult with the
Governor of Queensland and report to that Government
on all matters of importance. The Administrator
is supported by two State Councils, the
Executive and the Legislative, the first being
composed of the Administrator, the Chief Judicial
Officer, the Government Secretary, and a Resident
Magistrate. The second is composed of the
Executive Council, together with any officers they
may appoint.</p>

<p>Petty Sessions Courts are also established and
presided over by a Resident Magistrate, who has
the same powers as a Police Magistrate in the
Colonies. Europeans and natives have equal rights
in the courts, and an appeal is allowed under certain
circumstances. Native police preserve order in
the towns. An amusing thing about them is that
they are chiefly ex-convicts, and are given the
appointment as a reward for good behaviour whilst
in gaol. <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span></p>

<p>The discovery of the Solomon Islands is
credited to Don Alvaro Mendana de Meyer, who
went out there in the hope of discovering from
whence King Solomon’s wealth came—the supposition
was that the islands of the Pacific supplied
much of it. That supposition no longer exists.</p>

<p>On sighting the Solomon Islands, and believing
them to be the islands he was seeking, he named
them Islas de Salomon. This was in the year 1567.
After this he thoroughly explored many of them
and gave them the names they now bear—Guadalcanar,
San Christoval, and Isabel. Whilst thus
engaged he decided to found a colony, and with
that end in view he returned home and gathered
together a number of men anxious to make their
fortunes. He returned with them, landed at a place
he thought was part of the Solomon Islands, and
called it Santa Cruz. The colony was not a
success, as most of the immigrants, including the
discoverer, died, and the survivors returned to
South America.</p>

<p>One of these survivors was De Quiros, who
subsequently discovered the New Hebrides.</p>

<p>Bougainville and others, many years afterwards,
again came across these islands, and later they
were identified as those Mendana
de Meyer had <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
discovered and thought were part of the Solomon
Islands.</p>

<p>In 1873 the Solomon Islands came into notice
through the labour traffic. There was at this
time a demand in Queensland for black labour, and
traders who visited the islands found that they
could kidnap strong, sturdy natives and sell them
for good prices to the Queensland and Fiji planters,
with the result that, unknown to the Powers, a
big and scandalous trade was carried on.</p>

<p>The group consists of seven large islands and
no end of small ones, which are dotted about over
some 600 miles of sea at a distance of about 400
miles south-east of New Guinea.</p>

<p>Great Britain and Germany shared the islands
nearly equally until England ceded Samoa to
Germany in exchange for territory in the Solomons.
Now Great Britain owns the whole group with the
exception of Bougainville and Buka.</p>

<p>The story of the discovery of the New Hebrides
is also interesting. It was first sighted by Spanish
explorers, De Quiros and Luis Vaez de Torres, who
set sail from Peru in two ships to seek the Great
Southern Continent, which tradition told them was
somewhere in the South Pacific. De Quiros, as
before stated, came across the
New Hebrides group, <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span>
striking first one of the largest islands in the
northern part of it. This he named Tierra
Australis del Espiritu Santo, thinking possibly it
was an enormous tract of land instead of a small
island. Fired with ambition and the example of
his late <i>confrère</i>, Mendana de Meyer, he also
attempted to found a colony there, but, like de
Meyer, he had to return with his few survivors
and write “failure” across his enterprise.</p>

<p>Luis de Torres left De Quiros at the New
Hebrides, and it was then that he sailed through
the Torres Straits, which he named and reported
on in 1606.</p>

<p>For over a hundred years after the departure of
De Quiros from Santo nothing more was heard of
the New Hebrides.</p>

<p>De Bougainville then came across them, and
opened the way for the ubiquitous Captain Cook,
who sighted, made charts of, and named the
principal islands and headlands. The Spaniards,
though the first to settle there, never laid claim
to them, and they are now conjointly owned by
Great Britain and France.</p>

<p>Owing to their proximity to Australia they
have received more attention than the other islands,
and the Commonwealth of
Australia has shown <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span>
considerable interest in them and inaugurated an
emigration scheme to endeavour to wrest from
them some of their enormous mineral and vegetable
wealth. The results of the past few years show
great promise of future prosperity. In fact, in these
islands, in particular, there are resources which will
repay the labour and capital of any enterprising men,
and, according to those who are most fitted to judge
and advise, the New Hebrides is a veritable Eldorado.
But, until the natives are more civilised and certain
taxes are altered, men prefer to give them a wide
berth and seek their fortunes in lands less dangerous.</p>

<p>Another trouble that has lately arisen, is that
France, seeing the great possibilities in this new
colony, has inaugurated a preferential tariff for
French subjects. Had the same been done in
England and Australia no bother would have
arisen, but it was not, and, in order to compete
successfully with the French traders, the English
and Americans applied for naturalisation papers
which were granted, and though the Englishmen by
birth far exceed the Frenchmen, by naturalisation
the French, if not now, will soon be in greater force.</p>

<p>This is a matter of vital importance, and should
have the earnest attention of those who are interested
in the welfare of British subjects
in our Colonies.</p></div><!--section-->

<p class="psynopsis">New
Guinea natives—Port Moresby and its two native villages—Huts
on poles and trees—Native superstition and its result
on two tribes.</p>

<p class="pfirst">There no islands in the new world which have
been the scene of greater adventures, more daring
exploits, and more exciting times than those in the
South Seas. From the earliest days New Guinea,
New Britain, Solomon Islands, and the New
Hebrides have been inhabited by a race of savages,
on whom neither the efforts of missionaries nor the
oaths of traders have been able to make much
impression. For years the white man has tried in
vain to break the spirit of these cannibals; with fire
and sword whole villages have been swept away,
but neither by fear nor by kindness have the natives
been weaned from their worst customs, and it will
take many years and much education, and perhaps
the complete extinction of the old generation, before
they cease to be savages. For
over sixty years <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
the missionaries have been working amongst them
and have taught many to read, and sent them out
amongst their brethren armed with Bibles and tracts
in their native languages, but all this has been of
little avail; every day we hear of massacres and
risings, and missionaries and traders are pounced on
and murdered, and there is no accounting for these
outrages which make the problem more difficult
to solve. For months or even years men may live
on the friendliest terms with a tribe, and then
suddenly, and for no apparent reason, the natives
will rise up and slay them. The whim of a chief,
an angry word, a bad bargain, a superstitious fear,
any of these trivialities may be the cause of a rising,
and may mean the death of dozens of innocent
people.</p>

<p>But with all their disadvantages these islands
have a fascination for the traveller that no others
have, and when once the taste of the free and
adventurous life of the South Seas has been
acquired, there is always a longing to return to them
which nothing will suppress. Neither stiff joints nor
old age make one iota of difference, the yearning
will not be satisfied by anything short of a speedy
return.</p></div><!--section-->

<p>The deep blue of the sea, the
clear bracing air, <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span>
the screech of the wild sea-birds, and the roar of
the surf, as it breaks on the reefs, are sounds that
echo in the memory. To awaken and hear all
these things is the longing that clings to one. To
feel a good ship gliding through the still waters on
the way to the islands; to rise from one’s bunk
and through the port-hole to catch a glimpse of the
rugged shores and the dark, shining skins of the
natives as they paddle out in swarms from the
villages to the ship’s side; to hear them calling to
one another and yelling their greetings to the crew,
are things which, when once experienced, can never
be forgotten, and will ever haunt the memory.</p>

<p>But come, let us see these islands where the sun
pours down on bright yellow sands through the
long, waving, rustling leaves of the palm trees, and
glistens on the skins of the crocodiles basking in
the rivers, and on the strong, brown arms and
tanned faces of the traders, who have braved all
dangers for a life of adventure. Let us look into
the quaint lives of the natives—the last relics of barbarism;
let us see their huts and join in their weird
ceremonies and listen to their songs and learn
their superstitions, for in a few years these things
will be gone, and the cyclist and the tripper will be
crowding these savage islands,
whilst the sturdy <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span>
head-hunters will be dead, and their sons will be
cadging pennies, whilst the dark, shy girls will
be bold and talk with nasal accents.</p>

<p>Civilisation is coming, coming quickly. Even
here, back in the dense bush on a still night when
the insects are too lazy to fly and the silence almost
speaks, if you listen you can hear the steady tramp
of the ghostly army coming nearer and nearer,
crushing through everything, sparing nothing—the
army of civilisation.</p>

<p>The capital of New Guinea is Port Moresby, a
quaintly picturesque village facing a large bay with
a natural harbour. In the vicinity are densely
wooded hills, which stretch up and disappear in the
distance—a dark-green and black mass. But when
the sun is on them they dance with colour, and the
tints of marvellous brilliancy turn them into a lovely
fairyland, full of romance and adventure. It is
wonderful what strange tales flit across the mind
when looking at these hills; what scenes have been
enacted there in times gone by, and now, how calm
they seem!</p>

<p>Granville, the small business part of Port
Moresby, consists of a few corrugated iron-roofed
houses, the head store of Messrs. Burns Philp, the
great Australasian Trading
Company, and the <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span>
homes of a few Government officials, and Government
House, which lies back a little and looks
solitary and out of place in this weird land of pile-built
huts.</p>

<p>There is the Mission House also, a low, white
wood house with a big verandah running round it
and a garden of palms and beautiful flowers.</p>

<p>Hanuabada and Elevera are the names of the
two native settlements near Port Moresby. At
certain tides Elevera is an island, at other tides it
is a peninsula, but at all tides and all times it teems
with interest. Quaint huts built on long poles
line the shore and look like nothing one has ever
seen before. When the tide is high the water
washes right under them, swishing merrily against
the stout poles, and if you want to inspect one at
these times a canoe is necessary, but even then
it is a hazardous job unless you are used to it.</p>

<p>No one knows exactly why the natives went to
such trouble in building their huts, unless it was
with a view to protecting themselves against the
attack of an enemy from the land. There were no
wild animals for them to fear.</p>

<p>A regular street divides these rows of huts, all
exactly alike, but the inhabitants seem to know
where their friends live, though I am
sure the most <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span>
experienced London postman would suffer from
continual confusion if his services were required in
these parts. In the distance these villages look
very much like rows of haystacks built on stakes,
but on closer inspection they are particularly
interesting and have a very imposing appearance.
On reaching the piles one clambers up a rude ladder
and arrives on a platform made of ordinary poles
with gaps of a foot or two between each. Here it
is that the natives squat all day and do what work
they have, or, more generally, idle the hours away.
Above the platform is a kind of porch built on a
slant and projecting from the roof, which acts as a
protection against the sun or rain. Under this is
an open doorway which leads into the house.</p>

<p>From a sanitary point of view, no habitation
could be better than these pile dwellings, but for
comfort give me a modern hotel.</p>

<div class="dcaption">MOTU VILLAGE FROM THE SEA
</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>No furniture or mats are to be seen in these
dwellings to catch the dust, and you can squat on
the floor and see through the planks the waves
washing and swelling a few yards below. The
floor consists of the same kind of piles, only flatter
and broader than those used for supporting the
house. The platforms are arranged like big steps,
and many of the boards
are beautifully carved. <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span>
Some of them are immense pieces of timber, which
must have required a deal more energy to cut
than the Papuan of to-day is capable of exerting—much
less would he put them into position.</p>

<p>The wood used for the flooring is the hardest
obtainable, and seems to be of a material which takes
no heed of wear and tear; the planks are sometimes
heirlooms, and have been handed down from father
to son for many generations. One log tougher
than the rest is placed in position by the door, and
on this a fire will probably be burning and a woman
squatting by it cooking her lord and master’s
evening meal.</p>

<p>The rank yellow smoke which curls round her
does not inconvenience her in the least. She takes
no heed of it, but blows away at the embers, regardless
of smarting eyes and choking throat, probably
because she feels neither. She never fears that the
fire will spread and burn down her home, but just
goes on cooking. If you speak to her she may
stop blowing for a second and glance up at you,
but never a word passes her lips, and soon she will
be blowing again as if it was quite an ordinary
thing to have a white man staring at her. But
though the smoke does not trouble her a bit,
it blinds you, and you soon hurry
on to the <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span>
next hut, and there confine your attention to its
outside.</p>

<p>The roofs are thatched with palm leaves which,
though scant, keep out the rain and sun. The sides
and back are also composed of a kind of thatch on
a framework of bamboo or thin wood.</p>

<p>Unlike the habitations of many other branches of
this race, these huts show very little artistic work
inside. They are quite bare. A few cooking-pots
may be seen lying about, and these are the only
things which lead one to suppose that the huts are
inhabited. The resemblance of the interiors of all
of them is only equal to the sameness of the
exteriors, which makes it impossible to know which
one you have been in and which you have not.
This, added to the extreme difficulty a new chum
experiences in getting from one house to another,
does not add to the equability of his temper. It
needs a steady head and good balancing powers
to keep footing on these planks, many of which are
quite loose and wobble when you are treading on
them. After half an hour of such walking a
giddiness seizes you, and a strong desire comes over
you to kneel down and scramble along on hands
and knees to the next hut. But with practice, and
a certain amount of patience and
indifference to the <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span>
nasty fall one would get by slipping, walking can
eventually be accomplished with ease.</p>

<div class="dcaption">THE ISLAND OF ELEVERA FROM THE
MISSION STATION, PORT MORESBY,
BRITISH NEW GUINEA.</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The natives themselves run along the poles as
quickly as if they were on paved streets, whilst the
little kiddies scramble, and slip, and tumble about
as if they were on an ordinary floor. A fall through
the piles is almost an unknown calamity to them.</p>

<p>Under the houses, when the tide is out, the
natives can be seen cutting out their canoes, making
their pottery, repairing their fishing gear and
attending to other duties; but they much prefer to
loll about on the verandahs of their huts, looking
out at the sea, thinking of nothing.</p>

<p>The whole of Elevera only covers about ten acres,
but in that space the huts are crowded together,
and give cover to hundreds of healthy and prosperous-looking
inhabitants. On the mainland the
houses are built on small pile platforms, only three
or four feet from the ground, whilst others in the
back country are built in trees and look like gigantic
birds’-nests. This last custom, however, has quite
died out, for with the introduction of the axe the
protection of a house in a tree would be of little
use, for one blow would fetch the whole construction
down. Also the introduction of the police and the
work of the Government have
so diminished the <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
chances of tribal wars that the native no longer
goes to such trouble. In the old days the inmates
of these nests kept a supply of stones and spears on
their verandahs, and were able to use them with
great effect on their troublesome neighbours below.
Now such a position would only make them good
marks for a rifle shot.</p>

<p>The bush men, or “men belong bush,” to speak
in native parlance, are far more industrious than
the “men belong sea,” they who live by the shore.
For besides cultivating the land, growing yams,
bananas, and taro, they make a fair living by hunting.</p>

<p>Two distinct tribes inhabit the villages in Port
Moresby, the Koitapus and Motus. They live amicably
enough together now, but seldom intermarry.
The Koitapus were undoubtedly the original inhabitants,
and in colour are somewhat darker than
their friends, and have narrower heads, otherwise it
is very hard to distinguish one from the other; but
in their manners, customs, and language there is a
marked difference. The Motu tribe consider themselves
the superior of the two, though they live in
great fear of the mysterious powers the Koitapus
are said to possess, and were it not for this superstition
the Motus would soon overrule and probably
vanquish the other tribe.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dcaption">TREE HOUSE IN BRITISH NEW GUINEA
</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<div class="dxxpn" id="p023">{23}</div>

<p>So strong is their superstitious belief in the
powers of the Koitapus, that directly one of them
falls ill, presents are immediately despatched to a
Koitapu man or woman with instructions to remove
the evil influence that has brought the sickness or
calamity. The weather also is supposed to be in
the hands of the Koitapus, and be it wet or fine the
Motus have to pay up, that is if they want it
changed.</p>

<p>As a tribe the Motus undoubtedly are superior,
especially in such things as cleanliness, cooking, and
eating. The Koitapu natives will devour almost anything
with a relish unknown in civilised countries,
but the Motu is careful and particular both about
the cooking of his food and the article cooked.
Most of the Motus have their eatables boiled in
earthenware jars, whilst the Koitapu cooks his in
an earth oven.</p>

<p>The Motus gain their living chiefly by fishing
and making pottery, and they exchange both fish
and pots with the Koitapu for animal food, vegetables,
and the results of their agricultural pursuits.</p>

<p>The position of the two tribes is summed up
<span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<p>“Yours is the sea, the canoes, the nets,” says
the Koitapu man, “ours the land
and the wallaby. <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
Give us fish for our flesh, and pottery for our yarns
and bananas.”</p>

<p>It is on this understanding that the two tribes
live amicably together in Hanuabada and Elevera.</p>

<p>Altogether Port Moresby is as quaint and picturesque
a spot as ever was seen. A bright blue sky
and a sea the colour of which is for ever changing,
a stillness only broken by the roaring surf, the hum
of insects, the occasional cries of the sea-birds, and
the chatter of the natives, make up this delightful
haven of rest. No roaring train or smoking chimney
is there to distract the wayfarer; no newspaper
boy yelling out his “disasters” to cause one a sleepless
night. A spot in which to rest and dream,
ay, and study the curious customs of one of the
most interesting savage races in the world, if you
like that sort of employment.</p>

<p class="psynopsis">Natives who grow crops of hair—A word or two about the
women—Duties of married women—How they carry their
babes, and the philosophy of childhood.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The natives of New Guinea are fine specimens of
human nature, but taken as a race they cannot be
compared to the Maoris of New Zealand or even
to the Fijians. The men are infinitely better-looking
than the women, and their splendid stock
of hair, which they wear bunched up all over their
head, sets off their appearance in a remarkable
manner. The young women are bright and cheerful-looking,
and amongst them there are some
striking creatures; but there are many sad-looking
specimens, some of the old women are veritable
hags, and many fine young girls are quite spoilt by
the quaint habit they have of shaving their heads,
whilst some of the best specimens of men are
disfigured by their yellow, bloodshot eyes, so
noticeable in contrast to
their dark skins. <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span></p>

<p>As workers the New Guinea natives are probably
in advance of many natives of the adjoining
islands. They are, of course, better than the
aboriginal of Australia, who would as lief die as do
an honest day’s work, but that does not say much
for them. There is no doubt about it, they do not
love work, though they get through a certain
amount.</p>

<p>In Port Moresby the natives of Hanuabada and
Elevera live chiefly by fishing, canoe-building, and
pottery-making. The men do the fishing and
canoe-building, whilst the women and children
loiter over the pottery-making. There is a complete
absence of hurry; all the natives work as if they
had a lifetime to complete their job; there is a
calmness in them that is only rivalled by the sky
over their heads and the air that blows over this
island, and perhaps it is from nature they have
learnt that calm and stolid indifference to just those
things over which we believe it is necessary to
hustle.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="dcaption">IN THE PILE DWELLINGS AT HANUABADA,
PORT MORESBY, BRITISH NEW GUINEA.</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>One extremely peculiar trait in the character of
the natives of British New Guinea is their dislike
to inquisitiveness. You can implore a native to
tell you his name, and even offer him coin to pay
him for that information, but it has
no effect. He <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
will tell you some name, if you press him hard
enough, but it won’t be his, as you will discover if
you try to find him again. As an instance of this
peculiarity, Mr. Norman Hardy was particularly
struck by a canoe he saw lying on the sand in the
main street of Elevera, and seeing a native standing
by, he asked him if the canoe belonged to him, as
he would like to buy it. The native smiled blandly
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know whose it is?” asked Mr.
Hardy.</p>

<p>“Don’t know; man over there, p’r’aps,” said
the native.</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” Mr. Hardy pursued.</p>

<p>“No name.” The native shook his bushy head.</p>

<p>“Well, show me which is the hut he lives in.”</p>

<p>At this question the man began to fidget, and
then, glancing carelessly at the row of huts, all as
like each other as peas, he swept his hand past the
whole lot and said:</p>

<p>“That one.”</p>

<p>And that was all the information concerning the
name and possessor of the canoe that Mr. Hardy
obtained. Subsequently he learned that the owner
of it was the very man he had been questioning.</p>

<p>The same kind of reticence has
been found by <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>
all travellers who have been anxious to find out
the ways, the customs, and secret rites of the
natives; but, luckily, now and then a man who will
talk has been found, and then, by using the knowledge
gained from him and showing the others that
you know a certain amount about the matter, it is
possible to get a fund of information; though it is
always necessary to corroborate everything you
hear, as the art of lying has been brought to a
perfect science in these islands—probably by the
march of civilisation and the example the natives
have been set by the traders—nearly all natives
become liars when they are civilised.</p>

<p>Throughout the island the bulk of the work is
done by the women-folk, the men being little less
than pampered loafers. There is some sort of an
excuse for this, which, it is only fair to state, is the
result of altered circumstances. In the early days
the men were ever on the watch for enemies, and
lived in constant preparedness for a surprise attack.
By day they carried their spears and clubs about
with them, and by night they slept alongside them.
There were very few organised fights compared
with those of other islands, except when a big head-hunting
expedition was on, but at these times the
natives would get wind of it; what
they had to <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span>
guard against were small surprise attacks, and of
these they could not obtain information, as they
were generally planned on the spur of the moment.
Most of these stalking excursions were undertaken
to supply a sacrifice for a feast, and a native would
be singled out in some adjoining village to fill the
want, or else some chief would require the wife of
some other chief, and she would have to be stolen,
or a child had to be kidnapped to spite its parents,
and so the men in every village had to be constantly
on the watch, which, of course, hindered them
from working, and left the bulk of the labour to
the women; but now that civilisation has altered
the relationship of the tribes and lessened the
chances of these attacks, the occupation of the
men has practically ceased; under the new régime
they have gradually become loafers, and the
women still continue the duties they have performed
for generations.</p>

<p>Organised labour is almost unknown, but certain
yam patches are owned by certain natives, and the
women work them as they do the banana and the
cocoa-nut groves. In Port Moresby Messrs. Burns
Philp employ a number of men and women for
their stores, and for loading and unloading the
trading vessels, but even the heavy
work of carrying <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span>
the timber is sometimes done by the women,
whilst the men loiter about doing as little as they
possibly can. The police, who are clothed in blue
with white facings, are perhaps the busiest natives
in the township; what is more, they are extremely
proud of their clothes and their work, and their
exalted position as Government officials makes them
scorn their less fortunate brethren. Their duties,
beyond keeping law and order, are very slight, and
amount to an occasional job of rowing Government
men about and mounting guard over stray prisoners.</p>

<p>The native costume of British New Guinea is
meagre. With the men, when they are not
absolutely nude, a narrow girdle round their
waist is considered sufficient, whilst a bunch of
dogs’ teeth hung from their ears, a pointed, carved
bone run through their noses, and armlets of
vegetable fibre, would comprise a big outfit and
make its owner as proud as a peacock. At festivals,
dances, and funerals their clothing is more elaborate,
and they are more highly decorated with masks,
mats, and feathers. And when in mourning, they
are so over-dressed that it is impossible to recognise
that the bundle before you is really a human being.
The state or ceremonial costumes of New Guinea
vary considerably in the different
parts of the <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
island, and each tribe has its own particular fancy
as to what ought really to be worn, and what
ought not; the only consistency concerning clothes
throughout the island is found when the men are
either loafing about or working, and then they
wear as little as possible.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="dcaption">NATIVE OF BRITISH NEW GUINEA,
SHOWING THE MANNER OF WEARING
THE HAIR.</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The women and young girls usually wear fibre
aprons hanging from their waists to a distance of
about eighteen inches, whilst for dancing and
religious ceremonies more luxurious and more
lengthy ones, dyed in different colours, are worn.
When dancing the aprons of the unmarried women
are left open at the right side, so that the tattooing
on their hips and thighs can be seen. This bit of
coyness is to show that they are ready to be
married, and that they are still heart-whole, for
directly a girl reaches the marriageable age, and
wants all the men to know it, she is carefully
tattooed. Another mark of distinction between the
married and unmarried women is in the hair: the
married ones wear it very closely cut, while the
single ones pride themselves, like the men, on their
enormous bushy crops. This custom, however,
varies in different tribes, and the hair is arranged
in numerous ways, according to the fashion of the
part of the island in which the
native is born. <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span></p>

<p>The Papuan dandy takes no end of care over
his hair, which grows to a great length and is
frizzled and bunched up all round his head, and
some of them, farther up the gulf, arrange their
hair in this fashion purely for sale, and when a full
crop is ready they shave it off and sell it up country.</p>

<p>What “the man belong bush” uses it for I
don’t know, though some kind of string is seen in
different places which is probably made from it.
As in Fiji and Samoa and Honolulu, it is common
to see bleached hair. It is done for sanitary
reasons primarily, and fashion has helped the
custom. Tattooing, however, is not fashionable
amongst the men.</p>

<p>The children, like those of other savage races,
are completely nude. They are bright and happy
little beggars, and as a rule are free from nervousness
in the presence of strangers and whites. They
will stand round you in groups, with wide-open
mouths and eyes, but they have a tendency to
catch hold of each other, and those who are shyest
keep slightly behind the bolder ones. They are
born swimmers and divers, and seem to spend half
their days in the water, prancing, splashing about,
and diving, utterly regardless of time or season,
and I don’t think they
ever catch cold.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<div class="dxxpn" id="p033">{33}</div>

<p>Amongst the children’s games there are two at
least that look familiar to Europeans—a kind of
leap-frog and pig-a-back. The former is played
in all the varying ways of the English schoolboy,
single leaping and leaping whole rows; whilst pig-a-back
riding is quite the same game that our
children indulge in. Another game which is
interesting to watch is that known as <i>evanena</i>:
in this two rows of players stand facing each other
at a distance of about a foot apart, and when they
are thus arranged each boy catches hold of the
arm of the one facing, and grips it below the elbow
with one hand, and with the other he takes a firm
hold of his own arm with his disengaged hand,
thus forming a platform of human arms. A
boy then gets up on to this platform and runs
forward. Immediately he has passed over the
first pair they let go of each other and run
forward, and place themselves in front of the others
at the end of the row, thus making a continuous
passage, enabling a constant race to be kept up
with the boy on the platform and those forming
it. Roars of laughter greet the youth who is fast
enough to reach the end of the platform before
another lap is ready for him, and if he succeeds in
doing this he is a proud winner, but
if, on the <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
other hand, he stumbles and falls he is anything
but a hero, and becomes one of the figures of the
platform, taking the place of one of the end boys.</p>

<p>Many of the other games are rough, boyish
imitations of the sacred ceremonies which their
elders conduct with such decorum. Of course they
are not true imitations, because many of these
ceremonies are secret and none but authorised
natives are allowed to take part in them.</p>

<p>The girls have a few games of their own, but
very seldom join in with the boys. From their
earliest days they are trained to work, and playing
is considered frivolous and unwomanly. One sees
many more young women paddling canoes than
young men; the men prefer to play and watch
their sisters work. Chivalry is not a forte of
theirs.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>As soon as the girls are old enough they are
initiated into the art of pottery-making, cooking,
and other domestic duties, but what they all take
most pleasure in is dancing. Their sole ambition
in life seems to be to excel in this art—and become
wives; though the latter occupation has few
benefits, and, to the outsider who has studied the
life of the married women, marriage would seem
a grievous calamity to be
avoided at all <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
costs—at least a Papuan one. The work of the married
women is most arduous, and their whole existence
seems to be taken up in waiting hand and foot on
their loafing lords, bearing children, and bringing
them up. All the cares and worries of the precarious
lives of these natives seem to be thrown on
to the shoulders of wives, who bear it with a stolid
philosophy that defies imitation.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable things about the
mother is her unique way of carrying her child, a
method totally different from that of any other savage
or civilised race. From its infancy the baby is put
into a sort of miniature hammock made of vegetable
fibre, with a very fine mesh, through which the
little bundle of humanity can be seen kicking
merrily. When carrying the child, the ends of this
hammock, which are woven together and make a
circle of the net, are placed over, and rest on the
mother’s head. Thus the baby hangs suspended
in this arrangement just below the woman’s breasts
or over her back. It is a convenient arrangement,
for the mother is perfectly free to walk about and,
if necessary, work a little with her hands. As a
rule, however, when she is working she hangs her
child up on one of the cross-beams of her hut, and
many can be seen thus
suspended under the <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span>
verandah-like shades of the roofs, when they look
very much like cocoons.</p>

<p>This form of carrying a weight, however, is not
peculiar to the Papuan, as instances of it can be seen
in Egypt. A native porter will often suspend a
heavy portmanteau by straps from the top of his
head and jog along serenely with it. Child-carrying
in this way is, however, quite original and is, I
believe, only seen in New Guinea. The Maori
method of carrying them on their backs, wrapped
in a shawl which the woman crosses over her chest,
is infinitely better in some respects, as it enables her
to do hard labour without any inconvenience.</p>

<p>One trait that is particularly noticeable among all the children
of savage races is their silent philosophy. No matter what happens
these babes remain serenely calm; they may be left for hours without
food or drink, they may be hung upside down, dropped, trodden on,—in
fact, any calamity may befall them,—but still they are silent. The only
difference that is evident is when they have been uncomfortable for
hours and are suddenly put right, when they resume their kicking, but
very soon even this form of exuberance subsides, and silence, unmoved
silence, is restored.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3herein">CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="psynopsis">Concerning love and grief—How love is made in New
Guinea, and some of the charms used to ensure love and constancy—The
grief of a New Guinea widow.</p>

<p class="pfirst">To the marriageable young lady in civilised
countries, leap year, and with it her chance of
proposing, comes but a few times before she is
“on the shelf,” but in some parts of New Guinea
the proposal of marriage always comes from the
girl.</p>

<p>Some may think that this sort of love-making
and marriage lacks romance, but to the Papuan it
is the event of his or her life. It is in the hope of
receiving a proposal that a man will go through
endless adventures; it is to win the admiration of
some good buxom girl that he risks his life head-hunting,
and it is with pride and glory that he
glances at his string of skulls which hangs from the
poles of his hut, because he knows how brave the
women will think him. <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span></p>

<p>It is for this same object that he studies the
art of dancing, that he cultivates his bushy hair
(after he is married he often sells it) and the fine,
healthy glow of his skin. His lithe limbs also
come in for a deal of attention, and, as he struts
proudly about, it is always with the hope that his
superior charms and manhood may bring him the
love and admiration of a young maiden.</p>

<p>When a Papuan boy comes of age an interesting
ceremony takes place. At about twelve years
old, if he is of good stature, healthy and generally
fit, his parents think it is time to prepare him for
marriage, or, in their own language, make him
<i>ibitoe</i>. The initial stage of this ceremony is merely
a form of introduction to youths of his own age
who are also <i>ibitoe</i>. In England more or less the
same thing happens when a girl “comes out.”
She is then supposed to be on a footing with
“grown-ups,” and this is practically what happens
to the youth of British New Guinea. From the
day of his “coming out” he occupies his hours in
pleasure-seeking and has a good time generally;
this goes on for a certain period and then he
sallies forth alone into the bush to make his drum.
This drum-making is the most serious part of his
“coming out,” and is conducted with
a deal of <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
formality and ceremony which is quaintly mixed
with superstition.</p>

<p>Drums seem to be the most important possession
a young Papuan has; in shape they are not unlike
a golf bag on a somewhat larger scale. One end
is covered with lizard skin drawn taut and bound
round the end of the drum with fibre, leaving a
frill below the binding; the other end is open, and
at about the centre the instrument narrows off and
a handle carved out of the wood protrudes. By
this the drum is held when being beaten.</p>

<p>The making of this musical instrument is an
arduous task; it is hewn out from a solid block of
wood by means of the crudest instruments, the
hollow centre is made by burning it out with
cinders of red-hot wood.</p>

<p>In order to manufacture one of these the young
native retires into the bush, cutting himself off from
all intercourse with human beings. His food is
brought to him by his friends and left in some
secret places which are decided on before he takes
his departure. This is done so that the young
man can secure it without catching sight of those
who bring it, for it is believed by the Papuan that
if any human being sees him, or is seen by him,
during this period of <i>ibitoe</i> that
his drum will <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
be spoiled, or that when it is completed it will
sound as if it were cracked. Many other curious
superstitions relating to the eating of certain foods
are attached to this operation; for instance, if a
man who is <i>ibitoe</i> eats food cooked in the wrong
way, he will grow fat and be a laughing-stock to the
girls; whilst if he drinks fresh water it will quench
the fire with which he is trying to hollow out his
drum, and other things too numerous to mention
will happen if equally trifling details are not
adhered to; but provided he comes through this
important time without any calamities, and completes
his drum to his own satisfaction, he steps
forth from his seclusion to conquer the heart of a
maiden.</p>

<p>In the different tribes and parts of the country
the customs relating to love and matrimony vary.
In some the young men waylay the girls they admire,
and endeavour, by force or persuasion, or the offering
of presents, to obtain their consent. This
method often leads to amusing incidents, as the
girls have the privilege of scratching and fighting
their would-be lovers to any extent, and
the lover may not retaliate, or he would bring
down upon his woolly head the anger of the girl’s
parents. <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span></p>

<p>Sweet music of a sensuous nature is often resorted
to by the lovesick swain, and, leaning against
a tree, he will stand and play all day long, hoping
to attract the attention of his inamorata and bring
from her a proposal of marriage.</p>

<p>Tight-lacing and other forms of personal adornment
are also indulged in by these amorous youths,
and a more ridiculous sight could not be seen than
a young native with his waist so strapped in as to
form an enormous, ugly bulge above and below his
belt, but it is greatly admired by the girls and shows
he wants a wife badly.</p>

<p>In those parts of the western islands, already
alluded to, where the women propose, directly a
girl falls in love with a man she makes him a
string armlet, which, according to Professor Haddon,
she presents to his sister or to one of his confidential
friends. The confidential friend bides her
time, and when an opportunity arises she goes to
the man and says:</p>

<p>“I’ve got something for you.”</p>

<p>“Show it to me,” replies the young man if he
is anxious.</p>

<p>This the friend does.</p>

<p>After learning the girl’s name, and being satisfied
that he is not throwing himself
away, the youth <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
will accept the armlet and in return make a present
of two leglets to his fiancée.</p>

<p>Another custom in vogue is for the girl to send
food for the young man. At first on receiving it
he is generally obstinate and refuses to eat it, as
he has no desire to be caught—or pretends he has
none—but really he is very proud that at last he
has been noticed. The woman understands all
this and does not despair, but steadily pursues her
course, and day after day sends food to her lover,
until her constancy makes the parents of the young
man feel satisfied that he is not being led astray
or fooled by a changeable woman. As soon as
the parents feel sure of this, they go to their son
and command him to eat the food.</p>

<p>This is the signal which the girl’s friend has
been wanting, and she hurries to bear the news to
the waiting girl, who immediately prepares more
food which she sends him. Now the critical time
is past, and she knows he will be allowed to see
her.</p>

<p>All arrangements for the meeting are conducted
by the go-between, and when the young man is
presented to her, she hands him fresh food which
he takes from her and eats. At this act of condescension
great joy is shown on
both sides, and <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
the two lovers retire to the seclusion of their hut,
and without any further ceremony they become
man and wife.</p>

<p>The divorce laws of New Guinea are similar to
those of America, and a man or woman can get a
divorce on the slightest provocation—the general
cause is incompatibility of temper. Plurality of
wives is allowed if a man be rich enough to support
more than one. The first one, however, is chief
amongst them all and her word is law; the last
one acts as a go-between; she carries the messages
of number one to the others and sees that they
are properly attended to. If any of the wives
refuse to obey her, she and her husband are laughed
at, as it is generally considered that he has undertaken
more than he can manage.</p>

<p>The following is an interesting sample of a
missionary-taught, native girl’s love-letter, or form
of proposal. It was shown to Professor Haddon
when he was studying in those islands. The letter
was written to one Peter by name, whose own
translation of it reads <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<p>“Peta, what do you say? I try you. My
heart he like very bad for you. You send me back
a letter. Yes this talk belong me. Pita you
Good-bye. Me Magena.” <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span></p>

<p>Peter’s affirmative reply was:</p>

<p>“Magena I make you know. Me just the same,
I want very bad for you. My talk there. If you
true like me, all right just the same; good for
you, good for me. Yes all right. Finish. You,
Magena. Good-bye. Me Pita.”</p>

<p>The natives of New Guinea, like all other savage
races, still have their love charms, and when a man
or maid fails to win the heart of the one they love
by ordinary methods, they try the sorcerer and,
then, if that love they are seeking for cannot be so
obtained, their affection turns to hate and a desire
for revenge fills them, and they seek the other’s
death by resort to magic. There is a wonderful
similarity in human beings all over the world, be
they white or black, savage or civilised. But the
extraordinary part of the magic in savage lands is
that it always works, and if men or women are
properly cursed and their death prophesied by the
magician, they die, and in the way their death has
been foretold. The same strange superstition is
noticeable amongst the Maoris. I once was at the
death-bed of an old chief, who was supposed to be
dying of typhoid, but the real cause of his death
was fear. In some way he had offended another
chief, and that man had him cursed
by a Tohunga <span class="xxpn" id="p045">{45}</span>
or priest. I was unable to ascertain exactly what
he had done, but the result of it was that an image
made of clay, which was supposed to represent him,
was placed in a creek, and as the water washed
away the figure, so the chief gradually sank; and,
when the last particle was softened by the slowly
trickling water and vanished down the stream, so
that moment the soul of the old chief passed over
the border.</p>

<p>So strong is the superstition regarding these
things that a man who is cursed never dreams of
attempting to overcome the disaster foretold him;
he simply goes home and dies, and it is in this way
that this particular superstition, and others like it,
live. No one has the pluck or the common sense
to try and oppose their influence. In New Zealand
this kind of witchcraft is termed Tohunganism,
and in spite of the civilised condition of the Maoris
of to-day, there are still cases of death recorded and
put down to it.</p>

<p>In the same certain way that death is brought
about by a mental process—cursing—so miraculous
cures are effected, and Urio Moquru is one of the
most useful gods in New Guinea for this sort of
thing. When a person of importance falls sick, food
is placed before this grotesque image,
and the friends <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
and relations beseech Urio to remove the evil spirit
from their beloved one. But should the god fail
and the sick one die, the natives do not lose faith
in their god, but decide that the patient was either
too good to live, or so bad he had to die.</p>

<p>When death does visit a village there is a terrible
time of mourning, the women sit and cry round
the death-bed all day, and in the streets they can
be seen squatting in corners moaning. You can
meet women all huddled up giving vent to the most
despairing groans, and they look as if they were
literally wrapped up in grief; yet they may have
never cared a snap of the fingers for the dear
departed. But it is the custom for the women to
mourn; and a more awful sight and sound than
this moaning cannot be heard. The men show very
few signs of grief, and evidently trust to their
women-folk to do a double share.</p>

<p>When a woman loses her husband she goes into
mourning and will on no account be disturbed; for
this rite her dress varies; certainly she looks a
terrible fright, and I’m not surprised at her shrinking
from public gaze. There is a special dress and
general attire for this state of grief. They shave
their heads completely, cover themselves all over
with charcoal, and then put on
long petticoats with <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span>
tassels of seeds. They also cover their necks with
necklaces and their arms with trinkets. Having
done all this they retire into a corner of their hut
and remain there, away from the gaze of the public,
until their sorrow is worn out or they are tired of
being alone.</p>

<p>One thing noticeable is that, however loud their
moaning is, however hard they are crying, they will
always stop to answer any question you like to put
to them about their “late lamented,” if you have
courage enough to beard them and refuse to go
away. Then, as soon as you have gained all the
information you require, they will quickly resume
their tears as if nothing had happened to interrupt
them. But this is not unique to the savage of
New Guinea. I have met with the same extraordinary
species of grief amongst the women of
Great Britain,—it is world-wide, this interruptable
grief.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3herein">CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="psynopsis">Some native dances and queer costumes—Novel blackmailing
methods—Woman’s vanity and a censured dance.</p>

<p class="pfirst">For some reason, unknown to the ordinary layman,
the Church has taken a dislike to nearly all forms
of savage dancing, and many missionaries, brave
and good fellows though they be, have seen evil in
these performances where other less cultivated men
have seen nothing that suggests immorality. But
often what appears immoral to the Western mind
is quite free from any such suggestion to the mind
of the savage. I do not say that these natives are
paragons of virtue and morality, but in deference to
them it is only fair to say that they stick to their
code of morals, though it is not ours and may seem
rather lax to us.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="dcaption">A KAIVAKUKU, RORO TRIBE, CENTRAL
DIVISION, BRITISH NEW GUINEA</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>Owing no doubt to the missionaries disliking
certain dances, the natives are now very shy about
permitting a white man to witness them; some,
however, can still be seen, and these
I will try <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
to describe. There are several different dances in
New Guinea, all distinct in their movements, in
the costumes worn at them, and the music accompanying
them; there are the war dances, the
marriage dances, the fishing, festival and agricultural
dances, and for all these the costumes vary, some
of them being unique, for there is no island in the
world which can rival its assortment of ceremonial
regalia. In some of the dances the women are most
strangely attired, whilst in others the grotesque
costumes of the men are startling.</p>

<p>When the fish dance, or any other semi-religious
dance is to be held the men wear masks, for the
making of which they are famous, and then the
performance is indeed weird. In the Mekko
district, south-east of Port Moresby, most elaborate
masks of hideous design cover the heads of the
dancers, whilst their bodies are concealed by capes
which are nearly two feet thick and cover the
wearer completely, leaving only the lower part of
the legs visible, and these, in contrast to the bulk
above, look strangely thin and out of place. The
heat and weight of these costumes must be
enormous, but the natives would undergo any
discomfort rather than be without them.</p>

<p>The masks, which vary in shape
and size, are <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
generally not shorter than three or four feet, and
occasionally they run to six or seven. They are
held in position on the man’s head by a cross-bar
which he grips between his teeth, and they are
constructed on canework frames, and shaped like
an enormous hock bottle. A thin bark covering is
stretched over the frame, which is then completely
smeared with white lime, and a hideous face is
generally worked or painted on the front of it, with
the mouth and eyes enormously big and distorted.
When one considers that these masks and their
attendant costumes are also used for blackmailing
dances their thorough ugliness is warranted.</p>

<p>Blackmailing is a favourite pastime, and when
they are intent on it they don their ugliest masks
and steal round to the hut of the man or woman
from whom they wish to extort money, or frighten,
and in the dim moonlight begin a weird and unearthly
dance accompanied by horrible noises, which
they continue until the desired effect has been
obtained, and the man is frightened out of his wits
and ready to agree to his assailant’s proposals.
This dance is closely allied to the dook-dook dance
of New Britain. In New Guinea when the mask
and cape are worn the steps of the dance are slow,
and the movements are supposed to
be majestic and <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>
awe-inspiring, making the performances more like
stately processions than dances. One of the most
interesting of these is the festival dance for a successful
agricultural season. It is considered a kind
of prayer to the gods of agriculture, and it generally
takes place once a year and is conducted by
different tribes on each anniversary.</p>

<div class="dcaption">HARVEST DANCE, NEW
GUINEA

<p class="pfirst">When
the yams and bananas are ripe, the natives
hold a celebration, in which as a rule men dance
in close formation with the girls on the flanks.
Occasionally a girl edges her way in and takes the
arm of a man, as is seen in the illustration, where
the red head-dresses are those of women. The white
plumes of the men denote that they have slain an
enemy in single combat. The streamers down the
back of the man on the left are those of his head
fillet. Behind the dancers are the bananas suspended
on a scaffold. The celebration takes place in the
summer.</p></div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The dancing ground having been picked, the
villagers squat by their huts, or form a large ring
on the ground, and then when all is ready a troop
of men strangely dressed, each carrying his drum,
comes prancing on to the ground.</p>

<p>From the back of their heads long waving
strings, made of leaves, are hung, flying out behind
them and touching the ground. Their woolly hair
is gaily festooned with bright-coloured feathers,
white and red, pure white, pure red, and reddish
brown and green; and above these there is often a
brilliant red cockade which stands straight up.</p>

<p>Armlets adorn their arms, and a narrow belt with
a scanty attachment suffices for the covering of the
lower part of their bodies. Long streamers of palm
leaves hang, in some cases, from both armlets and
leglets. Their drums are also gaily decorated with
strings and streamers.</p>

<p>On arrival on the ground they form
up in rows <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span>
and begin a peculiar crouching movement by bending
their knees and rising on toe and heel, to the
accompaniment of a monotonous dull thumping on
the drums. Every now and then a different beat is
sounded, and instantly the men change their positions.
Whilst this peculiar shuffling movement is
going on a crowd of girls appears and begin to dance
in and out among the men, and then vanish again
almost as quickly as they appeared. Their costumes
are equally quaint, the chief adornment being
a mat hung round their waists and open on one
side. The remaining portions of their bodies are
nude, with the exception of necklaces and curious
feather adornments on their heads.</p>

<p>Fine creatures some of them are, and as they
prance about in striking attitudes, dodging in and
out of the rows of men, swaying their skirts backwards
and forwards, they present a fascinating
picture and, as they warm to the dance, the continued
shuffling movements of the men, the swirling
of the women’s skirts, their swaying bodies, and
glimpses of elaborately tattooed legs, and the
measured beating of the drums, the only sound that
breaks the silence, a giddiness steals over the spectators
and a weird feeling of monotony takes hold
of them.</p>

<div class="dcaption">READY FOR THE DUBU DANCE
</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<div class="dxxpn" id="p053">{53}</div>

<p>Then suddenly the whole scene will change, the
girls, who a few seconds before were swirling round
the men, vanish, the drumming ceases, the long
rows are broken up, and the men too disappear,
leaving only the crowd of eager spectators who
remain gazing at nothing.</p>

<p>A wonder comes into one’s mind if it is all a
dream, for throughout the whole dance no sound has
escaped the performers, and the silence and the half-darkness
produce a scene of peculiar uncanniness.
But soon all is movement again and other performances
have to be gone through. New figures are
introduced as in our round dances, but there seem
to be no set places for the girls; they appear and
dance independently in and out of the rows of men
as if to show off their fine figures, their beautiful
skins, and bewitching ways, some dancing and acting
more or less demurely, whilst others throw themselves
about with an abandonment and coyness that
it would take a most practised Western flirt to excel.</p>

<p>Every attitude and every movement seem to be
accompanied by an action of the apron or skirt,
which is swerving with a perfect rhythm backwards
and forwards, or from side to side. But this is not
the women’s dance, they are merely adjuncts to the
performance and use their admission to
it more for <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span>
love-making than anything else. Their real dance
comes later when they mount the Dubu, and this
is the dance so strongly objected to by the missionaries,
but, strange to say, the natives themselves
seem to take very little interest in it; they call it
“the dance belong women”; and were it such an
immoral proceeding, surely the men would crowd
to see it.</p>

<p>The ordinary Dubu is a rough platform about
four feet high and built upon stout piles. More
elaborate ones are to be seen in some districts, and
these are decorated with weird designs and strange
carvings, with flanges reaching out right and left and
long beams carved like gigantic bullocks’ horns and
decorated with gaudy tassels that add a quaintness
to them; they stand some ten feet off the ground,
whilst others have posts rising fifteen feet above the
ground and ending in a half-moon design, but these
bigger ones are not used for the girls to dance on,
but are kept for ceremonial purposes.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>A score of girls, dressed up to the nines in their
twine skirts (reaching about as far down as a
Parisian ballet girl’s dancing costume) and completely
tattooed, suddenly begin prancing through
the village, swinging in their hands a long string at
the end of which is a ball.
By practised movements <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span>
they make it curve in grotesque shapes around their
bodies, and all the time this is going on they are
swinging their skirts backwards and forwards by a
peculiar movement of their bodies, from their waists.
This extraordinary performance of pirouetting
maidens goes on for some time to the accompaniment
of drums. Then, at a given signal, they mount the
Dubu and discard their skirts, and stand unadorned
before the spectators who, as I said before, are nearly
all women. Then married women anoint them,
whilst others bring them baskets of areca nuts and
yams. The yams they cut up in pieces, and whilst
doing so go through graceful movements which
display their figures to the best advantage. Then
suddenly, at another given signal, they start pelting
the onlookers with the nuts, which are scrambled
for by the women amid laughter and screams of
delight; they are like children at a fair, and almost
as simple. When all the nuts are finished the
girls slip on their skirts and jump down, and so
ends this, the most terrible dance of the modest
maids of Papua. There is another famous dance
which takes place on the departure of the Lakatois
for the annual trading expedition up the Gulf.</p>

<p>Professor Haddon, in his book the <i>Head
Hunters</i>, relates an amusing thing he
saw at Veifaa, <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span>
of which this dress incident reminds me. He says
that though the natives in this place are never seen
in any but native costume, the missionaries have
insisted on the women wearing calico gowns whilst
attending divine service, and it was an amusing
sight, he continues, to see the girls and women
arriving at the church, for—on entering the courtyard—they
pulled these European costumes over
their half-nude bodies; but it was still more comic
to see the way they pulled themselves out of them
directly the service was over. He adds, that in spite
of their scant clothes and the above peculiarity,
the women are extremely modest.</p>

<p>Tattooing cannot be said to be as general in New
Guinea as in many other places, but in some districts
the women are particularly well tattooed, the whole
of the upper part of their bodies being completely
covered with intricate designs. The methods of
making the patterns vary, but as a rule, the woman
lies on the ground whilst two others work them
out with a stick dipped in burnt resin. When the
whole is finished it is pricked in by means of a sharp
thorn attached to a stick and bound tightly to it
with fibre. Most of the women have extraordinary
designs on their thighs, which they make a point
of showing when they are dancing.</p>

<p class="psynopsis">Outrigger canoes, their appearance and
construction—The famous Lakatois—How the natives catch their fish; and
a few words about fish that climb trees—A trip down the coast, and an
unpleasant experience.</p>

<p class="pfirst">If you can imagine a cloudless sky of a deep blue
colour, a sea so smooth that not a ripple is visible,
and so clear that you can look down into it and
see the dark rocks and the sandy bottom and
strangely shaped fish swimming idly about amongst
bushes of seaweed, which wave and curl with the
ebb of the tide; and floating masses of jelly which
occasionally double themselves into balls and then
become floating masses again. If you can picture
all this you will have an idea how clear the waters
of the South Seas are when the sky is cloudless.
The hot sun is overhead, and the still air is full of a
sweet fragrance. Just above you you will see a
frigate bird sailing lazily about, and by the sea
shore just a faint ripple and a line
of white show <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
you quaint and picturesque canoes—not the
ordinary mere dug-out things which are so narrow
in body that there is only room for a medium-sized
man to sit, but long curiously shaped ones with
poles stretching across and extended far out over
the side; they are slightly arched, and at the end
there is a log which rests in the water and lies
parallel to the boat.</p>

<p>These outriggers are queer constructions, but
no sea can upset a boat possessing them, and with
the light shining full on the bright skins of their
half-naked occupants, they look still more eccentric.
To see a dozen of these queer craft being swiftly
paddled through the water by men with bushy
heads and fine massive bodies, and women more
nude than dressed, but with their hair cropped
close to their skulls, is not a sight to be seen
everywhere, and well repays all the thousand
little disadvantages that journeying to these parts
entails.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="dcaption">LARGE TRADING CANOES, BRITISH
NEW GUINEA</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>There is a safety in an outrigger canoe that one
cannot feel in ordinary native boats. There is not
the same swift movement that one experiences
when skimming through the water rowed by a half-dozen
muscular Maoris in their light-built canoes,
or flying down rapids in a Canadian
canoe, but in <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
place of it there is the calm repose of absolute
security, and at times this latter condition is not
to be scorned, especially when every moment you
can see the fin of a shark rise out of the water.
Clumsy looking as these boats are, it is wonderful
what complete control the natives have over them,
how swiftly they swing them round or skim them
between dangerous rocks, and dash over the surf
through waves that would swamp and capsize an
average lifeboat. These irresponsible creatures
paddle on through the worst of waters, laughing at
the spray as it breaks over them, and shouting
with glee as they mount the great waves, which
carry them high and dry on to the shore.</p>

<p>Then the stately Lakatois with their queer-shaped
sails, looking as unlike sails as the body of
a boat is unlike a canoe. They resemble an elongated
kite with a semicircle cut out of the top,
and if you saw one for the first time coming towards
you on a dark night, it would give you a
fright, so grotesque and weird is it. In daylight,
however, its horrors disappear and the ingeniousness
of its construction appeals to you; after watching it
sailing placidly out to sea, steered as easily as any
yacht, a feeling of admiration for the savage inventor
of it comes over you. <span class="xxpn" id="p060">{60}</span></p>

<p>To explain its construction would be a task too
difficult for me, but, roughly, it consists of two or
three large canoes lashed together and boarded
over. On these boards is a kind of barn cut down
and spread out considerably. This is used both
for shelter and for carrying the pots and articles of
barter. From the centre of this raft-like barge the
two enormous sails project straight into the air;
the two horn-like points of the top are decorated
with long streamers; whilst others ornament
the sails, making it look like a carnival barge.
How the wind is caught or how the boats are
moved about is a mystery to any but those who
work them; if you ask a native he will explain it
all to you: “He good fellow belong salt water, go
easy.” And that is as much information as I can
give. So with this vivid, though somewhat technical
description of how the boat travels, you too
must be satisfied, and look rather at its beauty
than its ways of working.</p>

<div class="dcaption">OLD WOMEN MAKING POTTERY,
BRITISH NEW GUINEA</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The method of building canoes in these parts is
interesting. A log of soft wood is obtained from
an up-country tribe in exchange for fish or some
other produce, and its outside is shaped by means
of an ordinary English axe, while the inside is
hewn out with the native
stone adzes. These <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span>
they still prefer for delicate work, though they
often attach the head of them to an ordinary axe
handle. When a sufficiently deep hollow is made,
the native lights a fire in it and works it about
until the rough edges are smoothed down and
other faults are rectified.</p>

<p>Firing is also used to finish the outside, and
if the fire goes out, or anything but a perfect result
is finally obtained, they put the cause of it down to
some accident, or wrong action which they have
done in their youth. Nearly all their calamities
are thus explained.</p>

<p>The small canoes when finished often have the
outriggers completely boarded over, thus turning
them into big rafts, and making them capable of
carrying enormous quantities of barter; for it is by
boat they carry their goods from village to village
along the coast. The Lakatois are always used for
long trips, and carry big crews, being often loaded
to their full carrying capacity. When leaving Port
Moresby for these periodical trips they carry
pottery and exchange it for sago and other food.</p>

<p>The pottery industry flourishes at Port Moresby,
and at most times it is possible to see the women
at work. Men never assist them in this industry;
generally very thin
old hags seem <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
to superintend all the most difficult part of
the work. The clay used for it is, I believe, a
natural clay brought down from the interior and
exchanged for some other article. Instead of
using a pottery wheel, each pot is literally built up
from the inside and rounded with a stick or by
hand—the sphere getting larger and larger, whilst
the inside, towards the top, gets smaller. When
finished a fire is lit and stones built up over it, and
directly the right heat is obtained, the newly made
pot is placed on them and baked.</p>

<p>Nearly all the cooking is done in these contrivances,
and they seem capable of standing any
heat as well as a good deal of rough usage.</p>

<p>Sago, yams, bananas, sweet potatoes, cocoa-nuts,
and fish are the staple foods which the New Guinea
natives fatten on. The fish is often smoked and
cooked in the earthenware pots or eaten raw. The
method of smoking it varies, but generally it is
roughly done in a hut.</p>

<p>Owing to the extensive coral reefs all round
these islands, fishing by means of nets is a difficult
task, and one that does not often pay, as they get
torn to pieces on the reefs. Line fishing suffers
from the same disadvantage, so that when a big haul
of ground fish is wanted a method
introduced by the <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span>
traders is adopted—fishing with dynamite. This
sounds somewhat peculiar, but it is most effective.</p>

<div class="dcaption">SPEARING FISH, BRITISH NEW
GUINEA</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>Directly a shoal of fish is seen a charge of
dynamite is exploded in the water, which has a
most disastrous effect on the fish, as it stuns all
within a tremendous distance of the discharge.
Boats are then run out, and with the aid of the
natives the unconscious fish are picked up and
thrown into them.</p>

<p>The Papuans thoroughly enjoy the sport, and
dive and swim after the floating things with
great glee, laughing, and the shouting and splashing
as they swim through the water with a
fish in their mouth and one in each hand, is
tremendous. On reaching the boat they throw
them in and are away again as quick as lightning
after more.</p>

<p>Spearing is another method the natives have,
for which purpose they erect platforms in the
water. The fisher will stand on this platform with
a long spear in his hand attached to which is a
long thin cord. Holding the spear in the air,
ready to throw, he waits like a statue till his eyes
catch sight of a big fish in the clear waters
beneath. Then suddenly you see the spear fly
from his hand, and the next minute
he is yelling <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span>
with delight and hauling in a struggling fish at the
end of his spear.</p>

<p>The young natives are also fond of shooting fish,
and go off in parties armed with bows and arrows,
seldom returning without a good bag.</p>

<p>One often hears extraordinary tales of fishermen,
and perhaps there is none better than the
one told by Jerome K. Jerome of the plaster cast
that every one claimed to have caught, but even
this has to take a back seat when you are first
told that a man has seen fish climbing trees. But
in spite of the apparent tallness of such a yarn it is
nevertheless true. In New Guinea these piscatorical
gymnasts can be seen, and Mr. Hardy,
when visiting Tupusuli (one of the most unique
marine villages in New Guinea, lying a few hours’
sail south of Port Moresby), had the pleasure of
seeing these fish at their exercises.</p>

<div class="dcaption">MARINE VILLAGE, TUPUSULI, BRITISH
NEW GUINEA</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The trip was an interesting one and worth
relating. At the invitation of the Rev. Dr. Brown,
whose missionary work in these parts is well known,
Mr. Hardy accompanied him on a trip down the
coast to Tupusuli. Among the doctor’s guests
were Dr. Wyllie who was out there on scientific
work, Prof. von Yost, a German journalist who
at certain times claimed
direct relationship to <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
Bismarck, and a few others who also can verify the
following, as they too were among the party. It
was a jolly expedition, and the yacht, which belonged
to Dr. Chalmers the head of the missionaries in
New Guinea, was captained by a Raratongan chief
who was noted for his enormous strength. The
scenery along the coast is wild and broken; here
and there little villages backed by palm groves
can be seen, and natives running about on the
shore add to the beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>Tupusuli lies in a little bay, and is protected from
intrusion by coral reefs and mud-banks, but the
yacht safely manœuvred these, and then the village
came in sight. At low tide it looks extremely
weird, as some of the huts are built on very high
piles a considerable distance from the shore, right
out in the mud. The village proper is also completely
surrounded by water at high tide; behind
it is a row of splendid palms, and a broad street
dividing some huts where the men are generally
seen canoe-making. As the tide was out when
the yacht anchored, the party had to be taken off
in the gig and landed on the nearest mud-bank,
from which they waded into the village.</p>

<p>On the way they passed a clump of mangroves,
partly surrounded by water, and it
was here these <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
quaint little fishes were seen climbing up the bark
of the mangoes. In appearance they look like a
very small mackerel, though the head is rounder
and more nobby, and from the breast two little legs,
like those of a caterpillar, protrude. The tail and
fins are exactly the same as those of other small fish.
They seemed very shy, and on the approach of the
strangers they scuttled down the trunk and sprang
back into a pool of water at the foot of the tree,
and nothing would induce them to show up again.
Here at Tupusuli are the ruins of an old Dubu
house, which looks as if it had been an exceedingly
large one.</p>

HAVING A DRINK</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>After examining the canoes and many of the
houses the party made their way back to the gig,
and as the tide was now in they had not far to
walk. On reaching the yacht, however, it was
found that the anchor had got jammed, and as the
wind was blowing pretty hard and the tide running
in, the captain feared that they would go aground
on a very nasty reef unless they got away quickly.
All hands were brought to bear on the chain, but to
their horror they found that their pulling was of
no avail; all the time the yacht was swinging round
and getting dangerously near the reef. Suddenly
from the shore a dozen canoes were
seen coming out <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span>
full pelt. The natives had guessed what was wrong
and were rowing out to help. Soon the water was
black with canoes, and the shouts of the natives
were almost deafening. At last they were alongside,
and one standing in the bow of his boat looked
up at our captain. “Me fix him, captain, you get
anchor all right,” he shouted, and the next instant
he had dived head foremost under the yacht. No
sooner was he out of sight than another followed,
and so on till the water was in a regular foam with
diving and swimming natives, there must have been
dozens of them, whilst crowds of others hung
round in their canoes anxiously watching for their
comrades to come up and report progress. As each
woolly pate shot out of the water the watchers
called out questions, but without answering they
dived again—they had only come up for breath—and
neither the party nor the natives were
able to find out what was wrong. After nearly
ten minutes’ work they all came up, and their
disappointed faces told the tale. It was no good,
the anchor was completely jammed, and in spite
of all their efforts these good fellows could do
nothing.</p>

<p>To save the yacht from grounding the chain had
to be cut, and shortly after that the
yacht rode out <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
of the bay clear of the rocks, amid the cheers of
the natives.</p>

<p>Jamming of anchors in these parts is not an uncommon experience, and
to avoid losing them many skippers carry a charge of dynamite about
with them, which they slide down the anchor chain at the end of a piece
of slack rope. If the charge is timed properly and all goes well, the
coral, between which the anchor is fixed, is blown to smithereens.
Some skippers, however, have had any but pleasant results from this
experiment, and have not only lost their anchor but considerably
damaged their boats.</p></div><!--section-->

<p class="psynopsis">South Sea traders good and bad; their ups and
downs—Nicolas the Greek—The Mambare river massacre—Some queer creatures
with queerer ways—A fitting end to a wasted life.</p>

<p class="pfirst">There is a grim uncertainty about the life of a South
Sea trader. To-day he is alive and the centre of a crowd of cringing
natives who bow down before him, offering their goods in exchange for
others, obeying his every word, for he is their lord and they are his
slaves. But to-morrow may alter everything, and find that all that is
left of the once boastful trader is a mangled corpse.</p>

<p>He may curse the Papuan, he may cheat him
and rob him of his wives up to a certain point,
then the worm turns, and one dark night, when
the trader is lying unsuspectingly in his lonely hut,
murder steals through the jungle in the shape of
a naked savage whose eyes gleam with revenge.
Yes, there are no half-measures
with these savages, <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
no gentle stabbing, no single shot, but absolute
mangling in a ghastly form.</p>

<p>Sooner or later death has come to nine-tenths of
the traders; sometimes it has been unjust, but
more often richly deserved. The remaining one in
ten lives free from all trouble and in harmony with
his men, and he prospers and enjoys his life.</p>

<p>The majority of the men who trade out there
are rough, uncouth beggars, but they have a jovial,
devil-may-care way with them, taking both life and
death as they come; they rise in the morning, not
knowing if they will ever see their beds again in
this world, but they don’t mind that. Some of
them are as plucky as they are coarse, and as jolly
as they are muscular; but it is deplorable to think
that they are the men who are civilising and forming
the future of the natives, and with such guides
it is not surprising that they steal and murder, and
that in some parts no trader dare leave his store for
a night lest it be sacked by daybreak. A trader’s
existence is no life for a peaceful white man; it
means, as Louis Beck so aptly puts it, “a pistol in
one hand and your life in the other.” Yet there is
room for the honest man and plenty of money to
be made, for these islands abound in untouched
wealth, as the success of
Messrs. Burns Philp <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
shows. They have made money, and their advancement
shows that with honesty and enterprise there
is plenty of room for good men. A few more such
firms and the place would soon change and become
a prosperous colony, where decent folks could live
with some certainty of dying a natural death.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>There are tales galore, all filled with a grim
humour, of the small traders in these islands;
many of them are characters in their way, who have
drifted over the whole world and finally settled, or
become stranded, on these shores.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the best known about New
Guinea was Nicolas the Greek, whom Mr. Hardy
met at Samarai and describes as a man of medium
height and burly build, with a dark complexion
and a clean-shaven, Yankee-cut face. He dealt
chiefly in pearls, and had come on board the <i>Titus</i>
(the boat on which Mr. Hardy was) to sell some.
That day he wore a pair of canvas trousers, soiled
and very much damaged, a soft hat that had at one
time been black, and a dirty white jersey, which
was tucked up in a roll at his waist. In this roll
he kept his valuable pearls, and to get at them he
would unroll a little of the jersey, and then having
got hold of his pearl box he would work it up his
chest and bring it out below his
chin. His life <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
was not a rosy one, as he was wanted in all quarters
by white and black men, and several attempts had
been made to kill him, but he generally managed
to get the first shot home, and so lived on. He was
quite used to wrecks, for it almost seems that the
sea required his life too, but that also went disappointed,
for nothing seemed to be able to kill
Nicolas. He was a dangerous man to chaff, even
when he was well filled with wine, and most men
kept clear of him, or when they did have dealings
with him they were very civil and never gave him
a chance of picking a quarrel.</p>

<p>Old Harry Hutten, who blew his arm off with
a charge of dynamite whilst fishing, was a man with
a history as long as your arm, but he fell foul of
the natives, and was, I believe, found dead one
morning. Johnnie Pratt, one of the most decent
men out there, married a native bush girl, and by
doing so offended the shore natives, who eventually
killed him and carried her off, to show how hurt
they were at his not choosing a wife from the
“Women belong Sea.”</p>

<div class="dcaption">JOHNNIE PRATT WITH HIS IVORY NUTS,
AT SIMBO, SOLOMON ISLANDS

<p class="pfirst">At the time when I did the original sketch from
which this picture was made, Johnnie Pratt, a French
trader, was in health and prosperity. He had his
small house with the copra and boat sheds down on a
narrow beach under the shelter of a tropical forest
that spread upwards over the hills round a lovely little
bay. He was a jolly chap, and when last I saw him
was singing among his “boys” at work. He had
married a native girl, daughter of a local chief, and
at the birth of their child this chief gave him the
fore-shore round the bay. He seemed to have had a
happy time as times go in these parts, though his life
had been attempted more than once on a neighbouring
island. I do not remember now when it happened,
but not far from his place he was murdered, and so
came to the end many traders do in the wild
Solomons.</p>

<p>The drawing shows Pratt taking tally of the
weight of the sacks of ivory nuts which the “boys”
are bringing from the sheds to be put into boats. The
native in the foreground is wearing a sunshade.</p>
</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>But Dick Eade is one of the straightest traders
there, and will tell you, if ever you meet him, more
tales of the ups and downs of a trader’s life in half
an hour than you will hear elsewhere
in a lifetime. <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
A few years back he decided to take a trip home
to the Old Country, as he had made enough money
for a good holiday, so he left his partner in charge
of his store and sailed away. But directly he
reached Melbourne a letter was sent to him to say
that his partner had been killed, and that his boat
was high and dry on the rocks with a perforated
bottom. So instead of going home he had to
return and make a fresh start.</p>

<p>There is plenty of excitement in the South Seas,
and a glorious uncertainty in the life, and none
know it better than the traders and miners. The
most surprising thing is that often no cause can
be found to account for the natives rising. The
Mambare river massacre was one of these strange
risings, and when the survivors came to Port
Moresby the story they told of that mining venture
was grim indeed.</p>

<p>It appears that a party of miners, under the
leadership of a man named George Clark, went up
the river on a prospecting tour. They succeeded
in making friends with all the natives they came
across near the mouth of the river, and purchased
several canoes from them.</p>

<p>For the first week or so all went well, and in
every village they came to they
were well received <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span>
by the natives, who even assisted them to get their
canoes over the rapids which abound in the river.
In spite of these friendly demonstrations the
miners noticed that several canoes were following
them and that each one contained armed natives,
but as they showed no hostility and kept some
distance behind, it was decided to take no notice
of them.</p>

<p>They had travelled about forty miles up the
river, when they reached a point where it was found
necessary for all to disembark in order to get the
boat up a particularly difficult rapid. Clark, however,
remained in the boat to steer it, whilst the
other miners, assisted by the natives, hauled the
boat along with a tow-rope; the white men were
at the far end of the line whilst the natives were
close to the bow of the boat, there being in all about
a dozen natives.</p>

<p>Suddenly, when the boat was nearly at the top
of the rapid, the tow-line snapped, and after a
moment’s confusion one of the miners sprang back
and tried to seize the piece still attached to the
boat, when to his horror he saw it had been cut. He
yelled to his mates, but before they could come
half-a-dozen natives had sprung into the boat and
were being carried swiftly
down the stream. <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span></p>

<p>All thought that they had done this to assist
Clark in managing the boat, and no one suspected
treachery. Even Clark appears to have been
unalarmed, as he continued to guide the boat by
means of the steer oar.</p>

<p>From the banks the miners watched the boat
drifting until it reached the native canoes behind.
Then the truth flashed upon them; in a moment
a shower of spears were sent at Clark, and the
natives in the boat rushed at him. From the
banks the miners fired their revolvers, and two
of them sprang into the river and swam to rescue
Clark. In the meantime he fought like a Trojan,
but several spears had struck him, and suddenly
the miners saw him leap into the river, but directly
he came to the surface one native struck him full
on the head with a paddle, and just as he was sinking
another drove a spear into him.</p>

<p>The whole ghastly episode happened before the
swimmers could reach Clark, for the tide was strong
and the men were carried helplessly along. As
soon as Clark was disposed of, the natives threw
all the firearms out of the boat; the provisions
were taken to the other canoes and the boat
abandoned, whilst the perpetrators of the crime
beat a hasty retreat, but not before
they had been <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
well peppered by the miners, who by now had all
come to the scene of the tragedy.</p>

<p>Clark’s body was never found, and the miners,
having lost all their provisions, tools, and practically
all their arms, decided to return to the mouth of
the river. On the way down they were greeted
with spears and jeers, and had to clear their way
every now and then with a shower of bullets from
their revolvers, and yet when they had come by
these same villages on their way up the river they
had met with nothing but friendliness.</p>

<p>To this day the reason of the attack is not
known, in spite of the fact that the Queensland
Government sent an expedition to inquire into the
matter, and to capture the natives responsible for
Clark’s death.</p>

<p>Besides the grim stories of the Pacific there
are plenty of amusing ones, and sometimes funny
anecdotes are told of weird traders who have taken
up their quarters along the coast. No one can
go round far without meeting one, if not more, of
these oddities.</p>

<p>Aoba, in the New Hebrides, however, stands
unique in possessing the most original, if unorthodox,
trader who has visited these islands for many
a long year. Maybe the old chap
is dead and <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
buried now, for I am writing of 1894 when “Tartan
Jock” lived on Aoba. He was a wild Highlander
with chest and shoulders like an ox. His face was
as rugged as the mountains of his native country,
and his accent was one you could cut with a knife.
From his youth upwards he had led a life of
adventure, and had come at last to the most God-forsaken
island in the world to finish his days in
peace and quietness, and to this end he had chosen
the most dangerous and cut-throat part of the
New Hebrides. Yet he seemed to have no
particular desire that his death should be a sudden
one. A year or so before going to Aoba he had
paid a visit to his birthplace to see the old folks,
but his stay there had been a short one, and the
only result of it was that the brogue had gotten
into his nostrils again, and judging by the sound of
it would remain there till the sharp spear of one
of his black neighbours let it out.</p>

<p>As tough a customer as ever trod these islands
was Jock, but, strange to say, the natives rather
liked him, as was proved by the fact that his
tenancy of the tumble-down trader’s house on
the beach had been longer than that of any of
his predecessors.</p>

<p>Aoba has a reputation for being
a trader’s burial <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
ground, but, as far as I know, Jock is still above
ground; he was a man, too, who seemed to love it.
If ever you managed to come across him unawares
he was stretched out at full length on the bright
warm sand, with his arms at right angles to his
body, and his great legs spread out like young logs.
Jock could sleep all day like this, when there was
nothing else to do and no trading boats about where
he could get a “wee drappie”—Jock’s wee drops
were bottles. But when the wine was in, his wits
were out, and then it was a case of “look out for
yourself,” for at these times Jock was dangerous,
but basking on the beach he was a picture, and a
quaint one too, for he had an absolute horror of
civilisation and clothes, and a tartan shawl and a
Tam o’ Shanter hat, with more than one hole in it,
constituted his complete attire.</p>

<p>Stretched out at full length he could often
be seen on the beach, with his shawl wrapped
round his shoulders and chest, a great pair of bare,
brown, hoary legs sticking out, and his woollen hat
pulled right over his face with the nob of it where
his nose ought to have been. Like this he was a
sight that would have scared the life out of his
“puir mither.” But such was Jock, and when sober
a more amusing man would be
hard to find.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="dcaption">SOLOMON ISLAND BOY CLIMBING AFTER GREEN
COCOA-NUTS, NEAR GAVATU, NEW FLORIDA.

<p class="pfirst">Nothing was to me more refreshing after or during a
hot day in these islands than a long draught of milk from the green
nut. On arrival at a trader’s or settler’s station, if you did not care
for a “tot” of rum or “square face,” young cocoa-nuts were brought. If
there were none about, a boy was sent up the nearest palm to fetch some
down; when he brought them, one end was cut off with a large knife, and
then you could drink long and deep. A large nut will hold more than
one man can take at once. If you felt inclined you could eat the soft
inside with a spoon.</p>

<p>In the South Seas no one thinks of eating the nut when the hard
shell has come, it is then “Kaikai, belong pig,” and also made into
copra.</p></div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<div class="dxxpn" id="p081">{81}</div>

<p>His hut lay a hundred yards back from the sea,
hidden away in the densest part of a clump of bush,
and not a white man slept within miles of him,
yet Jock was happier there than he had been for
years, and when the boat called he always had
plenty of copra and as good a show of ivory nuts
as any of the traders.</p>

<p>Fifty miles from here there was one day a
curious scene enacted: James Clark, a new trader,
whom Messrs. Burns Philp were starting, had
refused to go ashore at the island for which he was
destined, owing to some ghastly reports he had
heard whilst the steamer was lying outside it. The
supercargo, a splendid fellow, was puzzled to know
what to do, but at last suggested that he should
try Aoba, where a trader was waiting to give up
his store. Clark jumped at the idea, though he
was warned it was, if anything, worse than the
place at which he had refused to stop: he was
sure, he said, no place could be.</p>

<p>A more depressed man than Clark during the
remaining week of his voyage could not have been
met, for bad accounts of murdered and boycotted
traders were in the air just then. However, Aoba
was reached at last, and after having supplied
“Tartan Jock” with his goods and
relieved him of <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span>
his copra, the steamer sailed on to Clark’s landing-place.</p>

<p>Here a most awful picture presented itself to
the unhappy man.</p>

<p>The retiring trader rushed to the shore as he
sighted the boat and waved frantically. He was
an old worn-out man in a filthy pair of pyjama
trousers and a coat torn and ragged. He looked
as if he had neither washed nor slept for weeks,
and he afterwards told the crew he hadn’t had a
decent feed for a month. His account of the place
was horrible in the extreme.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason the natives there
had strong objections to traders in their territory:
the one before him had been killed, and this man, I
do not know his name, had been warned several
times that, unless he went, he too would share the
fate of the last. The natives had point blank
refused to bring him copra, and to add to his discomforts
had stolen nearly all his food. Day and
night he had had to watch lest they killed him.
His copra shed had been burnt down, and all his
clothes, except those he stood in, had been seized
and distributed.</p>

<p>This was the place on which poor Clark was
landed, and his misery was too
awful for words; <span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span>
but there was no other station vacant, and so the
only thing he could do was to stay.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the supercargo and a few of
the crew he was taken to his hut, which lay a
little way from the beach. It was almost in
ruins, and contained nothing but a bed, a few
empty boxes, and some soiled pages of illustrated
magazines. After looking inside, he turned to one
of the crew, who had shown sympathy for him,
and said in the most plaintive <span class="nowrap">tone:—</span></p>

<p>“This is a fitting end to a wasted life.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the steamer left the bay,
and the last those on board saw of Clark was as he
stood by his boxes on the shore waving a farewell
to them.</p>

<p>Bad as the natives were to him they did not
butcher him, and some months after a vacancy
was found at Tanna Island which Clark took.
His stay there was very short, for within a month
a bullet sent him to a better land.</p>

<p>Such were the lives of the majority of the
traders a few years ago, but things are better now,
though there is still room for improvement, and
still plenty of opportunities
for good men.</p></div><!--section-->

FLORIDA</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The Solomon islanders have a name for being
the most treacherous and bloodthirsty race in existence, but when one
remembers the way they were treated by the first invaders of these
islands, <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span> the Spaniards and
French, and afterwards by the whalers and the roughest traders that
ever stepped aboard a schooner, it is really a wonder that they permit
a white-faced man to pass within coo-ee of their islands.</p>

<p>From the earliest days they have learned to fear
the white men, and, acknowledging their superior
powers and weapons, they naturally resorted to
treachery and cunning to outwit them. If they
had known the white man only as a benefactor,
their attitude towards him and their state of
civilisation would have been very different from
what it is now. The possibility is that they would
have developed into as fine and intelligent a race
as the Maoris.</p>

<p>Had the Maori war been at the beginning of
the white man’s career in New Zealand, that
country would not be the paradise it is to-day, nor
would the coloured natives be the men of knowledge
and wisdom some of them are. They would
have been given such a bad start that they would
not have got over it.</p>

<p>From the very beginning the Maoris were
treated with respect, and their naturally fine disposition
answered to the call, and thousands of
them so trusted the Englishman that
had the war <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span>
gone on for another thirty years their faith in
him would not have been shaken.</p>

<p>The Solomon islanders have had no chance,
they have been feared from the beginning and shot
down on the slightest provocation. It is only now
that they are beginning to discriminate between
the bad and the good white man, and I am perfectly
safe in saying that a straight man can go amongst
them unarmed, and if he treats them well he will
be as safe with them in the densest bush as he
would be in crowded Piccadilly.</p>

<p>The native villages are very different from those
in New Guinea. Very few of them are built on
piles, but in some of the small interior villages pile
dwellings can still be seen. They are, however,
only some two to four feet off the ground, like
many others found in the countries of all savage
races. Streets, too, are not discovered as often in
the Solomons as elsewhere, the houses being built
with no particular design. A clump of bush will be
dotted with houses, with only small paths leading
from one to the other. The houses are of the typical
hut shape, built of wood and thatched. A ridge
pole resting on two uprights supports the roof which
is triangular in shape, and the sides are formed in a
similar fashion. Before thatching,
both the roof <span class="xxpn" id="p087">{87}</span>
and sides are formed by poles lashed together on
which the thatch is worked. The door, if it can be
so called, is merely an aperture which opens from a
raised platform, and to get into the hut it is necessary
to step—one generally falls—down into the room.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dcaption">EARLY MORNING, GAVUTU, SOLOMON
ISLANDS</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>There are no windows, and the door is the only
place for letting in the light and letting out the
smoke of the fire, which is generally burning in the
centre of the hut on the floor. Most dwellings are
divided into two parts; one is used for sleeping
purposes, whilst the other is occupied in the day
time. The Solomon islander is luxurious and likes
a bed to lie on, which is made very much like an
ordinary miner’s bed: two logs form the top and
bottom on which rest a dozen or more long poles
lashed together. The whole is covered with mats.
A pillow made of a small round log is used by the
particularly luxurious.</p>

<p>Beyond the actual necessities, such as these beds
and a few cooking-pots, and weapons of war and
field, there is nothing else in the huts, and the interiors
are gloomy and depressing.</p>

<p>The platform outside is used by the owners to sit and lounge
on. The roof of the house projects over the platform and protects
those sitting on it from the sun and rain. <span class="xxpn"
id="p088">{88}</span></p>

<p>Each house belongs to its individual owner,
and not, as in many other places, to the village.
There are strict laws governing property, and on
the death of the owner it is handed down to his or
her nearest relation. The same law applies to yam
patches and land plots. Each man holds certain
rights which are protected by the people, and
though the laws are unwritten, they are closely
adhered to—superstition playing a great and important
part in preventing any violation of them.</p>

<p>The chief of the village generally inhabits a
much larger house than his subjects, and in
many cases he has other houses round him for
the accommodation of his wives, relatives, and
descendants.</p>

<p>Palavanua is the name by which the smaller
houses are called, and Euro is the name given to the
larger ones. Though the Euros are of similar construction,
they are far more elaborately built and
are generally used as a shelter for war canoes or for
the spare habitation of a chief. Nearly all villages
have an Euro in their centre, and they are sometimes
used on state occasions for meetings and ceremonies.
The chief’s private house is taboo, or sacred, and no
one but he may enter it; an awful calamity would
befall an intruder. <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span></p>

<p>Some chiefs have a separate compartment in
their own home where their wives sleep, whilst
others prefer to have them a little distance off.</p>

<p>Each house has one particular pole in front of it,
holding the ridge pole which is “Hope,” or sacred.
It is grotesquely carved with figures in threatening
attitudes; and all manner of rubbish is laid at
the foot of this household god, piled up loosely,
and looking very much like an ordinary rubbish
heap. Old axe-heads, tins, shells, worn-out hats,
canes, old cooking-bowls, and pipes, are amongst
the most popular articles given to this god.</p>

<p>There seem to be no particular laws regarding
sleep, the married women only are partitioned off,
whilst every one else is at liberty to sleep where he
or she feels most inclined.</p>

<p>The canoe houses are very well built. Ingova’s
at Rubiana was a particularly good one, having
two large doors with slits above them running
nearly to the roof to admit the long and high prows
of his canoes. The sides of the house were partitioned
off into shelves where his favoured guests
were allowed, and expected, to sleep. On three
sides it is surrounded by dense scrub, or was a few
years ago, and the front looked out on to the lagoon.
This place, Rubiana, is one of
the most difficult <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span>
places in the world to enter, and it was probably
chosen by the wily old chief for that very reason.
One entrance from the sea, termed the “back
passage,” is simply a maze of small islands, and it
requires a man not only of extraordinary courage
but of consummate skill to navigate a boat through
them without damaging it. Having safely manipulated
the passage all is well, and the wide expanse
of clear calm water which fronts Rubiana well
repays the anxiety spent in reaching it.</p>

<p>There is little wonder that in this stronghold
Ingova was able to defy his enemies, and with his
army of head-hunters carry terror into the villages
of his neighbours, but of these exploits anon.</p>

<p>Tambu houses are also built and used as meeting-houses,
and being freed from “taboo,” in the sense
that any one may enter them, they are used by the
young men of the village as a kind of rendezvous,
and crowds of natives can always be seen lounging
about in them or sitting in rows gossiping. They
are also used for general meetings, councils, and
certain ceremonies. It is customary, and etiquette,
to go direct to the tambu house on arriving at a
village, and there, before the crowd, state your
business. In this way you are sure to win the
good opinion of the natives.
There are always <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>
plenty of them waiting to hear anything of
interest.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="dcaption">OLD INGOVA’S WAR CANOE HOUSE, RUBIANA LAGOON, NEW
GEORGIA, SOLOMON ISLANDS.

<p class="pfirst">Fifteen years or more ago, old Ingova, the notorious
head-hunting chief of Rubiana lagoon, was about at
the height of his power, and his raids of slaughter to
neighbouring islands were of dreadful frequency. It
was to this canoe house that he returned after a
successful expedition in his great TOMAKO (war
canoes) laden with ghastly trophies, but ever since
Rear-Admiral Davis, then of H.M.S. <i>Royalist</i>, sacked
this place in 1891, all has been comparatively quiet,
though I did hear, while I was there, that Ingova had
led a head-hunting raid or two.</p>

<p>The old shed, for it looks very like one, stands
near the margin of the lagoon, not far from the fringe
of the thick bush and forest. All is fast falling into
decay, and the whole place has a haunted feeling
about it. Inside was an old war canoe and the remains
of former splendour. Till you came to look
carefully at the structure its size did not strike you,
but I found it was about 72 feet long by 30 broad,
and quite 30 odd feet to the top pitch of the roof;
the high slots above the two doors were made to let
out the tall fore-peaks of the canoes.</p>
</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The erection of a tambu house is generally an
excuse for a big festival, and at one time required a
human head to be sacrificed and eaten, and was
thus the cause of many a head-hunting expedition.</p>

<p>Bones of human beings can still be seen hanging
in these houses. The body of the victim was
always eaten at the feast, and, besides it, pigs,
fish, and other animals were devoured in large
quantities. Gorging is anything but a crime in
the Solomon Islands; in fact, it is not an uncommon
sight to see a native so puffed up with
over-eating that his friends have to lay him out on
the ground and then gently knead his back—this
operation they find helps to digest the food, though
personally I would not like to recommend it to a
dyspeptic.</p>

<p>At Santa Catalina there is a very fine specimen
of a tambu house, over sixty feet in length. All
the principal posts are carefully carved with weird
representations of fishing expeditions, fights, war
canoes, head-hunting expeditions, and other pictures
of the daily life and occupations of the Solomon
islander. The ridge pole, which is bigger than the
usual run of these poles, is carved
all over with <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span>
pictures which no modern journal would care to
reproduce. The roofs of most tambu houses are
more or less alike in general construction. They are
supported on four or five rows of posts, the central
one being about fourteen or fifteen feet high, whilst
the outside ones do not run to more than three
or four feet high, owing to the slant of the roofs.</p>

<p>Throughout the group there is not one village
standing out above all others, and there is no
capital town, but on every island there are villages,
and the chief in each considers his the capital.</p>

<p>The two largest islands of the Solomon group
are Bougainville and Guadalcana; Bougainville, the
larger of these two, belongs to Germany.</p>

<p>Guadalcana, from the sea, is an uncanny looking
place—a great dark mountain gradually rising
to a height of 8000 feet, covered with dense, dark
foliage and culminating in a volcano. The
Lion’s Head near by is a ragged cluster of grey
rocks. Here and there patches of sage green
relieve the monotony of colour and show where
clumps of palms are growing. A thin line of bright
yellow sand, and the white foam of the sea as it
breaks over the reefs, add colour to the island and
make of it a strange picture.</p>

<div class="dcaption">ON THE FRINGE OF A PRIMÆVAL
FOREST, SIMBO, SOLOMON ISLANDS

<p class="pfirst">One
of the most impressive sights to be seen on some
of these islands was the real tropical forest. This
picture shows just the commencement of one, through
which a native track wound its way. Though it was
a brilliantly fine day, yet I remember when we were
fairly into the forest depths it was just like twilight;
while here and there long streaks of sunlight were
streaming through the tree-tops, reminding us of the
lights coming through the windows of a cathedral.
We all went Indian file, and in many places the bush
was so thick that we lost sight of each other; now
and then we came upon a small native village.</p>
</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>On the east side of Guadalcana is
a little trading <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span>
station, where not long ago “French Jack” resided,
until at an untimely moment the blacks swooped
down on him, carried away his wife and cut him to
pieces; the crew of the little trading-boat, when
it called for his copra, found his remains and buried
them. But this is an old story, one of the many
that come from these islands. A call from the
Governor and the arrest of a few of the culprits is
the way in which these stories end, and the captives
eke out the rest of their existence in durance vile
at Fiji, or if proved guilty pay the proper penalty.</p>

<p>For his place of residence poor “French Jack”
had chosen one of the brightest spots on the island
and built his hut in the most approved style, with
an uninterrupted view of the sea. Close by his hut
was a long shed where his servants, or “boys” as
they are called, slept after their work of drying
the copra, husking ivory, and attending to the other
light duties of a trader’s establishment. At the back
of his house was his yam patch and banana grove;
behind that the wild thick scrub and the bush.</p>

<p>A lonely spot for any one to live, but such are many of the settling
places of a trader, and to those who live in the bush there is no
feeling of loneliness: in the crowded streets of a big city these same
men might be overpowered by their solitude.</p>

<p class="pfirst">This man was said to have “kaikaied-man plenty”

I was no good to eat. His teeth were stained red by chewing the

<div class="section">
<p>Travellers, scientists, and traders
still visit the <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span>
interior, and some come out all right, but to every
one that survives a dozen succumb, simply because
cannibalism is to a certain extent a religious
ceremony to these natives.</p>

<p>They do not kill and eat human beings for the
sake of their taste, or because they are hungry, as
some writers will insist on having us believe. The
cause is farther back than this; in nearly every
case when human beings are killed and eaten, it is
on occasions when such a sacrifice is necessary,
according to the natives’ religious beliefs.</p>

<p>Like the prophets and priests of old they believe
in sacrifices; they honestly consider that they are
doing the correct thing when they kill, cook, and
eat a man or woman, and it will take many years
and many missionaries to persuade them to the
contrary. Of late, however, there are indications
that in some of the islands head-hunting is losing
favour, particularly with the younger generation,
which sounds satisfactory, for if the rising generation
decide against the practice it will soon die out.
Other causes sometimes arise which may help to
stop the custom. For instance, in one part of New
Georgia the chief, some years ago, gave orders that
no more human flesh was to be eaten, which to
many might look as if his
cannibalistic views were <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span>
changing, but the cause of it was not a moral, but
a physical one: the last feast of man they had
indulged in caused an epidemic of sickness to run
through the tribe, and the chief did not wish such
a thing to occur again. He felt that either the
digestion of his tribe had altered, or that the particular
tribe on which he had been feasting was no
longer palatable, so he stopped it. Again, in other
parts certain chiefs boast that they do not eat human
flesh, and hope is again raised that these savages are
reforming, but a little closer inquiry shows that the
particular chief deals in human flesh, trading it to
other natives, and, like the man who makes the
sausage, he does not eat it.</p>

<p>Throughout these islands there are very few
tribes who are still actually cannibals, in the sense
of the word as it is generally accepted, but in spite
of this grain of promise life is just as uncertain,
because one can never tell when a head is needed
for a religious ceremony. You may live on the
most friendly terms with a tribe for months, and go
away with the idea that cannibalism is dead, and
laugh at those who have tried to make you believe
otherwise, but had you remained one day longer, or
the chief’s son died one day sooner, that laugh would
never have come off, but instead
your head would <span class="xxpn" id="p097">{97}</span>
have, and your comely carcase would have been
frizzling in the kai-kai dish; and the very men
who had made so much of you a little before, would
with equal glee have made less of you then.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>When standing before a chief, who is smiling at
you and treating you to all the courtesies his nature
can conjure up, and knowing that with him you
have trusted yourself for many an hour’s smoke or
solitary ramble in the bush, it is difficult to
realise that the same chief a week before was on
the warpath, concocting the most devilish schemes,
and carrying out the most fiendish atrocities on
men, women, and children in his pursuit of heads.
But such is the case, and one can only account for
the inconsistency of it by putting these acts down
to a religious mania, and thus giving these otherwise
amiable and interesting creatures a certain excuse
for actions which to us would seem inexcusable.</p>

<p>Tribe after tribe has been completely wiped out
by certain powerful chiefs through a continued
series of head-hunting expeditions. The methods
adopted by the aggressive party are simple and
generally most effective. The Rubiana natives are
perhaps the most bloodthirsty of all the Solomon
group, and, being both rich and powerful, they can
descend on a village and overpower
it by sheer <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span>
force of numbers, even without the use of modern
weapons, which are now owned by nearly all the
important tribes. The most notorious head-hunter
in later years was Ingova of Rubiana lagoon, New
Georgia, to whom I have already alluded. He is
old and wizened now, and his hand trembles as
he lifts the glass of grog he begs from you, after
telling a yarn of the good old days. Yes, Ingova’s
strength and valour are gone now, and could the
departed spirits of the hundreds he has killed in
days gone by see him as he is to-day—his feeble
limbs, his shaking hand, his bloodshot eyes, and
seared face—they would indeed wonder what it
was they feared in him. Where is the great spirit
that once possessed him? they would ask. They
would scorn him now, and the women would laugh
at him—poor, feeble, tottering Ingova.</p>

<p>Years ago Ingova’s Euro was hung with skulls,
hundreds of them were strung in the cross-beams,
with staring, vacant eyeholes, which looked out of
nothing and yet seemed to see everything. Their
drooping lower jaws, showing sets of white teeth
which glistened in the rays of the moon, made
Ingova’s heart throb with pride as he stood and
tried to count them. White naked skulls of brave
men all hung in rows—they had
all belonged to <span class="xxpn" id="p099">{99}</span>
men, for a woman’s head is not worthy of such an
honour.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>One day, soon after one of Ingova’s rash
ventures amongst white men, Commander, now
Rear-Admiral, Davis played havoc with his village,
burning and sacking it. It was no ordinary attack
but a clean sweep he made of Rubiana, and then
the shore was littered with Ingova’s skulls: skulls
that he and his fathers had collected for generations
were scattered in all directions, and lay bleaching
on the beach, some half burnt and others cracked
and broken.</p>

<p>That was an awful day for Ingova, and for
months after he was a broken-hearted man. But
the savage spirit was still in him, and he was
not long in recovering from the shock, and to
rectify his loss he set out on a big head-hunting
expedition.</p>

<p>His mode of attack was an ingenious one. He
would start out with every war canoe he possessed
(some twenty or thirty, manned with a force of five
or six hundred men—swarthy, hard, muscular, dark-skinned
men), and a British built whaling-boat.
Having previously decided on the island he meant
to surprise, he would send out two flanking parties
and probably land a small force
lower down the <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
coast. Then, accompanied by the whaling-boat, he
would make straight for the front of the village
like an innocent trader, and having enticed the
natives to the shore he would commence his
slaughter. The two arms of his force would close
in and kill all those who failed to get away, the
others he would drive back to the centre of the
island where the land force would be waiting to
drive them to the shore again, killing men all the
time. Thus hustled and attacked on both sides they
were trebly trapped, and would fall like sheep before
the shots and tomahawks of Ingova’s five hundred.</p>

<p>But with all his efforts Ingova never regained
the long rows of heads of which he used to be so
proud, and now he is too old to go out and look for
more, but not too old to forget Captain Davis’s
little visit to Rubiana.</p>

<p>He wears no necklace round his neck now, for
Admiral Davis has it, it having been given him
by Ingova many years after that little visit as a
kind of peace offering—they are quite friendly
now.</p>

<p>Mai was another chief whose reputation for head-hunting and absolute
brutality was a household word in the South Pacific. He was chief
of Sapuna in Santa Anna, and periodically raided <span class="xxpn"
id="p101">{101}</span> the adjoining islands, killing and butchering
every one who crossed his path.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The idea of this carved wooden head on the prow is to
frighten off the evil spirits, or kesoko, of the waters and look out
for dangerous reefs.</p></div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>Dr. H. B. Guppy, in giving an account of his
acquaintance with him, says, that on his (Dr.
Guppy’s) arrival at Santa Anna he learned that
Mai had just been out on one of his raids. He had
led a war party across to Fanarita, on the opposite
coast of St. Christoval, to avenge the death of a
fugitive from a labour vessel, who, having escaped
at Santa Anna, subsequently found his way to
Fanarita, where he was killed.</p>

<p>The excuse, although somewhat circuitous, was
quite sufficient for Mai, who really thought more
of this chance of gaining new laurels than of the
untimely end of a native whose death he pretended
to be so eager to avenge. Having reached the
part of the coast where this man was killed, the
war party lay in ambush and slaughtered a chief
and two women as they were returning from their
yam patches, whilst they severely wounded another
woman who escaped into the bush with a spear
through her back.</p>

<p>Mai had a knack of keeping his followers up to
the mark by working on their superstitions and
never letting old feuds die out.</p>

<p>The islands of Isabel and
Guadalcanar were the <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span>
hunting grounds for the New Georgia chiefs, whilst
occasional visits to Florida Island helped them
along. From ninety to a hundred heads were
often brought in by some of these chiefs, the result
of a long and successful raid, and many travellers
who visited these islands between forty and fifty
years ago state frankly that the lives of the natives
in the less powerful islands were not worth a day.
They never knew when a canoe might land with a
force superior to theirs and wipe them all out; the
wonder is that there are so many still alive. It is
only owing to the falling off of these ghastly
expeditions that they have had time to recover and
repopulate their villages.</p>

<p>With such massacres going on and the practice
of infanticide always in vogue, the present state of
the natives is almost marvellous, and only shows the
hardiness and regenerating powers of these islanders.</p>

<p>Nowadays head-hunting, as I have already
stated, is only resorted to on certain occasions, and
when a head is needed a sum of money will often
be offered for one, and the chiefs of different
villages are acquainted with the fact. A hunt
round is immediately made, and any native who has
made himself objectionable to his neighbours is
sold for the purpose.</p>

<p>Neither the time of his death nor the fact that
he is to die is told him, so that he is relieved from
all worry. He is watched most carefully, and a
certain hunter is told off to procure his head. It
may not be for weeks after the sentence has been
passed that it is carried out, but when once the
decree has gone forth the man is as good as dead.
The hunter may have been ingratiating himself
in his victim’s good books, and thus waiting his
opportunity for months; then one day, when the
unsuspecting victim is quite off his guard, the flash
of a spear or the dull thud of a tomahawk is all
that he knows. The next day his head is carried
to the chief and the shell money paid over for it.
Then the feast or ceremony for which this ghastly
object is required takes place amid much rejoicing.
White men have often fallen victims to this custom,
and many a trader has only received warning from a
friendly native just in time to escape the same fate.
Money has often been paid down for the head of a
white man, and if he has not heard of it in time to
escape, his death has followed.</p>

<p>The missionaries, however, have seldom suffered; they are tolerated,
and seem to go on in a quiet and peaceful way, quite secure where every
other white man’s life is in his hand.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The native dress of the Solomon islanders is even
more scanty than that of their neighbours the New Guinea natives.
Usually the sole clothing of the men consists of a “T”-shaped garment
encircling their waists and passing between their legs. Unmarried women
and children fail to see any necessity for clothing at all, except
those in places where the missionaries have brought their influence to
bear; then a loin cloth is worn similar to that used by the natives of
Fiji, Samoa, and Honolulu, to cover their nakedness.</p>

<p>Though the Solomon islanders do not clothe
their bodies with cloth, they endeavour to cover as
much flesh as they can with ornaments and flowers,
and a keen competition is kept up
in the discovery <span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span>
of new ornamental shells, and in trade articles with
which to adorn themselves.</p>

SUNSHADE, A SORT OF CROWNLESS
HAT MADE OF GRASSES: IT CAN
BE WORN AT ANY ANGLE.</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The men are always attempting to rival each
other in this respect, and go through endless torture
as a result. They wear tight armlets, heavy ear-rings,
anklets, and nose-rings, the weight and discomfort
of which would be more than most white
men could stand.</p>

<p>Shell necklaces are among the most handsome of
native ornaments, and they are made from various
kinds of shells, cut and ground down, and in some
cases beautifully polished. The Tredacua shells are
most popular, and portions of them are converted
into most artistic ornaments. Armlets are made of
these shells, but it is a most tedious job and takes
the maker ages to accomplish, as the circle is
generally cut out with a rough piece of iron and
then finished off by a course of rubbing with sand.
Both men and women wear armlets, and, as most of
them are placed on their arms when they are quite
young, they become extremely tight as the wearer
grows up, and look as if they would destroy the use
of the limb. For some unexplained reason, these
bracelets seem to have little or no effect on the circulation
of the blood, which compels one to notice
that custom is responsible for
many quaint problems. <span class="xxpn" id="p106">{106}</span></p>

<p>The most extraordinary ornaments, however, are
the grotesque ear-rings worn by the men. When
quite young, a small hole is pierced in the lobe of
the ear, generally with a stone, and the opening thus
made is filled with a piece of banana leaf wound up
and twisted so that it acts as a spring, continually
enlarging the hole until it is big enough to be filled
by a piece of wood, or circular looking-glass, or any
other quaint thing the possessor of the hole can get
to put in it.</p>

<p>Some of these holes are considerably bigger than
the man’s ear. Lieutenant Boyle T. Somerville,
who made a point of studying these particular
natives, says that he measured one native’s lobe hole
and found it was four inches in diameter, and Dr.
Guppy states that he has seen natives carrying their
pipes and matches in these gaps, and on one occasion
he saw Taki, the Wano chief, with a heavy
bunch of native shell money hanging from each
ear. Taki said it was a sign of mourning for a
recently deceased wife—it certainly needed some
explanation.</p>

<p>Nose-rings and other nose ornaments form another
disfigurement for which these natives have a
weakness. Lately the women have taken to making
very pretty ornaments of trade
beads, which they <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span>
work into curious designs and arrange with peculiar
mixtures of colour; some are also ornamented
with wild flowers, and present an almost artistic
appearance.</p>

<div class="dcaption">A RUBIANA NATIVE, SOLOMON ISLANDS

<p class="pfirst">This portrait shows a native wearing large ear-rings;
the lobe of the ear passes round the wooden ring.
In travelling through dense forest they take the
wooden rings out and tie the long ear-lobes under the
chin. The gorget of pearl shell with a fretted-out
MBELEMA (frigate-birds) suspended round the neck
is supposed to invite the protection of the spirit called
“PONDA.” The man’s hair is turned yellow by
the use of lime. The armlets are of shell and hair
or grass; the design on the ear-rings may be a
frigate-bird <i>motive</i>; it is made of pearl shell let into
the wood.</p>
</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>In Rubiana strange native methods of hair doing
can be seen. Some men’s is cut in the most
fantastic way and ornamented with bright plumes
and flowers, and occasionally one possessing an
extra fine crop of bushy hair will have it propped
up with a piece of old hoop iron, and then if he can
get hold of a comb, as he often can, he sticks it
through the hair and the effect is weird.</p>

<p>Some also bleach their hair and make it the
colour of straw, though this is not met with as often
as in Samoa, where I have seldom seen a native
without bleached hair, or without hair that shows
signs of having been bleached at one time.</p>

<p>The same custom of shaving the head when
in mourning is in vogue here as in New Guinea.
Tattooing, however, is not nearly so popular, and
very few natives in New Georgia show any signs of
it. In place of it they paint their faces with lime,
and look rather like clowns.</p>

<p>Raised cicatrices are very popular, and some
quaint designs are worked on their bodies. Lots of
natives have a porpoise and a frigate
bird carved in <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span>
this fashion on their bodies. Most of the designs
are extremely crude, owing, no doubt, to the custom
of the boys who cut them on each other with rough
shells.</p>

<p>Regarding their food and their ways of cooking
it, and even the hours of having it, the natives are
very happy-go-lucky, and there seems to be a free
and easy sort of dropping in on each other when
the smell of cooking is in the air, and of partaking
of anything that is going. Mr. Hardy himself
witnessed a peculiar incident of this kind at Simbo.
A native had been out collecting eggs laid by some
bird which hides them in the sand, and on returning
the native went into an old chief’s house near the
shore, where a small fire was burning on the floor
just inside the door, and began stirring the inside of
the eggs up in a piece of cocoa-nut shell. This he
placed on the fire and continued stirring for a few
minutes. Then apparently getting tired of the
operation he got up and sauntered off. His place
was immediately taken by another native, who also
stirred for a while and then ate some of the
mixture. Whether the eggs were not to his taste,
or the mixture was too hot is not known, but he
made a terrible face, put the shell back on the fire,
and walked out
of the hut.</p>

<div class="dxxpn" id="p109">{109}</div>

<p>Two other natives tried their hand at the concoction
and left it as he had, and presently the
original owner came back and finished the remnants.
During the whole of this scene the old chief sat
unconcerned, and amused himself playing with a
club for which Hardy gave him a piece of tobacco.
The chief’s heart having thus been won, he
pulled down a magnificently carved club from the
eaves of the house. It was carefully wrapped up
in palm leaves, and the old man handled it with the
greatest reverence and care, but beyond the fact
that it was a ceremonial club he was unable to
explain anything about it or for what special ceremony
it was used, as his English was not over strong.</p>

<p>No amount of tobacco, however, would tempt
him to part with it—the very idea of selling it
seemed to hurt him.</p>

<p>After hiding it away he next produced an old
musical box and requested Hardy and Dr. Willey
to “make him sing.” The instrument was sadly
out of order, but after a little manipulation they
were able to get it to grind out fragments of
<i>Faust</i>, with long stops between every few bars.
This, however, did not bother the old man in the
least, the delight on his face was grand, and he was
so pleased that, after hearing the
noise for about <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span>
ten minutes, he took the musicians all over the
little village.</p>

<p>It was a curious place, huts were dotted here
and there in an artistic disorder among the palms
and banana trees. The chief led the way, and behind
him, following like a well-trained dog, was his
slave, a man belonging to some other tribe, and
quite different in appearance and physique from the
natives in Simbo. It is customary to keep slaves
for various reasons besides that of service—if a
human head is needed in a hurry, the slave’s is
handy. Crowds of little children and pigs were
running in and out amongst the scrub, and both
seemed to take a great interest in the white visitors.</p>

<p>After endeavouring to explain many interesting
things, the chief took his guests to his private house,
which was a well-built roomy place, after the style
of an ordinary farm-barn, with low walls and a deep
slanting roof. The inside was perfectly destitute
of furniture, and the only place on which to sit
was the floor, or a low shelf, which the old man
probably used for a bed when he wanted one.
Close to the house, and sheltered from the burning
sun, was a very fine kai-kai dish, which the chief
showed them with much pride.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>It was on a small platform raised
some four feet <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span>
from the ground, and underneath it there were signs
of a recent fire. In size the trough was considerably
larger than an ordinary coffin and somewhat
like one in shape, though at each end there was a
piece of carved wood. This one, the chief explained,
was not used for cooking human beings, but for
mixing and cooking food on feast days.</p>

<p>When explaining this fact, Mr. Hardy says,
though I can only take his word for it, as I was not
there, that the chief looked at him with a hungry
eye and murmured to Dr. Willey, “He go in nicee,
make good kai-kai.”</p>

<p>But to return to native diet: sago, taro, sweet
potato, sugar-cane, bananas, and a very poor kind
of bread fruit, constitute their chief vegetable food;
fish and occasionally a pig are their only other
eatables. The cooking of these articles is generally
done in rough bowls or in a European iron pot.
When anything special is going to be eaten it is
broiled in an earth oven. Betel-nut chewing,
however, seems almost to satisfy these natives, for
their meals are most erratic, and they often only
take a small piece of fish with them when they are
going out for a whole day’s tramp or work.</p>

<p>The method of chewing betel-nut is rather
interesting. The nut is about the size
of a walnut. <span class="xxpn" id="p112">{112}</span>
This they place in their mouth with a green leaf
and chew it. When it is well under way they dip
a small stick into their lime gourds and add a
modicum of lime or ground coral to it. The effect
of this mixture is, so some say, equal to a glass of
good grog, but, though it acts as a strong stimulant,
the natives do not seem to suffer any ill effects
from it. Chewing is in no way restricted to the
males, both women and young girls favour the
practice, and relish the betel-nut as
a great dainty.</p></div><!--section-->

of the most <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{114}</span>
exciting of their sports to watch. A man stands on
a rock, for preference, and throws out a line some
thirty or forty feet in length, attached to the end
of which is a floating bait of some fatty matter;
below him and bending double into the water is
another native, who works a little piece of bamboo
cut off at the joints and having a hollowed-out
groove in it. With his thumb in the end of the
hollow and his hand gripping the stick he works
this backwards and forwards in the water, giving it
a peculiar twist, which makes it send forth a weird
and uncanny noise. This sound, so they say, is in
imitation of the cry of female or male, I forget
which, bonito, and so attracts to it a mate.</p>

<p>Whilst one man is steadily working in this
manner, the other on the rock is watching every
movement of the native with an alertness and
excitement which is shown by his tense attitude.
Long before the untrained eye has noticed anything
peculiar, this fisher has gradually begun to draw in
his bait, and soon the great head of the bonito is
seen rising out of the water in an endeavour to
catch the bait. But the fisher, who by now is in a
perfect steam of excitement, adroitly snatches the
bait away only just quickly enough to save it. The
bonito dives, and the next instant he
is up again <span class="xxpn" id="p115">{115}</span>
and after the tempting morsel at full swing. From
that moment a most exciting chase begins, and the
extraordinary way in which the native gradually
entices the great fish to within a few yards of the
shore without frightening it, or allowing it to seize
the bait, is as fine a performance as one could wish
to see.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>All this time the other man is working away at
his bonito call. Then suddenly the water is lashed
into foam, and the man on the rock is straining
every muscle. The fish is hooked, and three or four
adroit tugs at the line bring him in to the foot of
the rock, where he is pounced on by the two men,
speared, and landed. Even then the game is not
ended, for a bonito dies hard, and a struggle of no
mean order is sometimes gone through before the
natives have conquered.</p>

<p>To see two black figures struggling with a fish
nearly as big as themselves is an extraordinary sight,
and is perhaps the most exciting part of the sport.
More than one native has been injured in the last
act, but that only adds to their keenness to conquer,
for they have unlimited courage, as every one who
has lived amongst them knows—except, I may add,
when superstition plays a part, then they are the
most abject cowards. <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span></p>

<p>Kite-fishing, though less exciting, is another
popular form of fishing and is conducted in the
following manner. A large kite is sailed behind a
canoe, and attached to the tail of the kite is a line
with a bait which just touches the water. The
gentle bobbing of the kite makes the bait jump on
the surface, in the same way that an ordinary angler
makes his fly play on the water. This is supposed
to suggest the presence of a small fish, and the kite
is there to represent a bird hovering over it. In
this way large fish are attracted and caught.</p>

<p>Ordinary line and hook fishing is also used,
and the hooks are beautifully made, sometimes of
mother-of-pearl and sometimes of turtle shell.</p>

<p>On a moonlight night a party of natives will go
out in their canoes to fish for the makasi, a large
fish which feeds round the mouth of rivers and
lagoons. This is a somewhat dangerous sport, owing
to the captive fish occasionally being attacked by a
shark just as it is being landed, which sometimes
results in the canoe being upset, and its occupants,
the fish, and the shark all getting mixed up. Such
an excitement and noise is caused by the yelling
fishermen that the shark is often frightened, and
clears off without even tasting either the fish or
the fishers.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="dxxpn" id="p117">{117}</div>

<p>The most ingenious devices in the way of nets
are used in different parts of the island. Some are
even made of a tough spider’s web; whilst others
are almost the same in construction as the English
net and, strange to say, are knotted in a similar
manner. The hand-net varies in length to about
eighteen inches and is made on different kinds of
wood, often bamboo. The mesh is small, and the
handle is, as a rule, most elaborately carved with
representations of sharks, frigate birds, etc., and
is made of wood. For ordinary purposes a two
and a half inch mesh is used, but a six inch is used
on the larger nets for big fish.</p>

<p>A party of natives will often be seen carrying
peculiar flat hand-nets made of light bamboo, with
an arched top, varying in length to some eighteen
feet. Armed with these queer-shaped things they
wade out into the shallow water, where they know
a shoal of fish is at play, and by pushing their
nets before them they form a circle round the
shoal and thus have it at their mercy. They are
wonderfully sharp in knowing when a school of fish
is about, and they show a surprising amount of
energy in capturing it.</p>

<p>Dynamite is now frequently used by the natives
here as in New Guinea, as they
have learned from <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
the traders that it is an easy method of obtaining
big hauls, and anything that saves them labour they
immediately adopt, as long as it does not interfere
with their old customs.</p>

<p>There is another form of fishing which is pretty
general all round the coasts of the different islands.
Bèche-de-mer, or the Malayan trepang. It is a
curious-looking thing like a piece of india-rubber,
very tough and flexible, and is found on coral
reefs. It has no eyes, nor does it seem to possess
any means of getting about. In length it varies
from six to twelve inches and is between two and
three inches thick.</p>

<p>The natives gather them off the rocks or catch
them in very low water; and immediately after
they have got a basket full they clean and dry them,
and then boil them for about a quarter of an hour.
Some are cut open like a herring and smoked over
an ordinary wood fire for about a day. The Bèche-de-mer
industry is a big one, and Chinamen are
very fond of it, as they can make good money
by it without a large outlay. Great care has to
be taken in storing the fish, as the slightest damp
causes them to rot.</p>

<p>Spearing fish from a platform built on piles a
little way out to sea is also
popular here amongst <span class="xxpn" id="p119">{119}</span>
the boys, and their well-trained eyesight comes into
play; having once spotted a fish they seldom miss
him with their spear.</p>

These small octopi form a part of the natives’ food.

<div class="section">
<p>In mentioning the native eyesight, personally,
I don’t think any of the savage races are better
equipped in this respect than we are. What
appears to be keenness of vision is only training,
and I have noticed the same keen-sightedness
amongst cattle-men in the Colonies. They will
recognise a cow miles away in the scrub, which
unaccustomed eyes cannot even see when the
animal and place in which it is are pointed out.
A little practice, however, soon overcomes this,
and in a very short time the new chum is as quick
as the old Colonial in spotting cattle. I mention
this experience, as I have seen a good deal of
nonsense written on the subject, and the extraordinary
strength of the natives’ eyesight in these
parts has been commented on. I know that,
with a little practice, any one possessing average
good sight can equal these so-called extraordinary
creatures.</p>

<p>The same thing applies to the power shown by
natives of throwing the voice. Necessity has made
these men speak to each other from long distances,
and so they have unconsciously
dropped into the <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
right method of doing it. They cannot tell you
how it is done—they just do it.</p>

<p>To return to island sports, there is nothing from
an Englishman’s point of view to beat a good pig-hunt,
and in the Solomons it can be enjoyed better
than in most places. In all parts of the bush pigs
can be found, in fact, the one thing the traveller
has to look out for more particularly than anything
else, is the sudden rush of an angry boar. There
are no dangerous snakes or ferocious animals
inhabiting the bush, and you can pass a night
under a tree with perfect safety, and sleep
as securely as in your own bunk, provided, of
course, you are on friendly terms with the natives.
Pigs are the only things that need watching.
When a sow has a litter and you accidentally
come too close to her haunt, then there is
trouble, and the nearest tree is the safest spot to
make for.</p>

<p>In hunting pigs the native dogs come in useful,
but only for starting and rounding them up, for
it is seldom they will actually attack and kill them.
That part of the business, including the long chase
over fallen trees and through masses of vines and
the thousand and one other obstructions, is left to
the hunters. The natives themselves
are keen on <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span>
the game, and are very smart with their spears and
tomahawks. The white men tackle them as a rule
with gun or knife. One of the most exciting pig-hunts
I was ever in was when our whole party
was armed with sheath knives only. The pig
was bailed up against a big tree and we closed in
on him, knives in hand, and, whilst his attention
was being attracted by one of the party, another
rushed in and struck the fatal blow.</p>

<p>Those bush pigs are larger than the ordinary
unfattened farm pig, and the boars have very fine
curved tusks almost equal to the Indian pig. The
young ones have a delicious taste, and when properly
cooked in a native oven make very good eating;
they are as tender as chickens.</p>

<p>The wily opossum leads its hunters a rare
dance, but the natives, who are its chief hunters,
enjoy the game thoroughly. It is a sport at
which white men are no good as it necessitates
remarkable agility in tree climbing. The boys run
up the trunks of the trees and give chase to the
little animal from tree to tree. They follow the
opossum as quick as lightning, until the poor
creature is driven to the ground. Then, of course,
he is captured easily, as his clumsy movements
prevent him from running at
any great speed—all <span class="xxpn" id="p122">{122}</span>
his powers of swinging by his tail are lost when he
gets on the ground.</p>

<p>Owing to the thickness of the undergrowth in
the bush hunting is not over enjoyable, and it
generally resolves itself into a track-making
expedition, and the only way to ensure a safe
return to the village is to mark the trees as one
goes. There is such a similarity in shape of the
trees and the lay of the country that it is impossible
to remember the way one has come, and as the
light only penetrates dimly into the thickest parts,
one cannot get any knowledge as to the shape of
the tops of trees, a method by which one is often
able to travel with certainty in less thickly growing
bush. This darkness also prevents one from getting
one’s bearings by the sun, so that tree scarring is
the only sure method of avoiding unnecessary delay
in the bush.</p>

<p>Crocodiles are met with pretty frequently in the
swampy districts and in the rivers. They are of
the usual type, ranging from six to fourteen feet in
length. They do not seem to mind salt water in
the least, and are often observed quite a distance
out from the shore, in fact, when they are chased
they generally make for the sea. I do not know
whether this is common with
crocodiles in other <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span>
lands, but those in the South Sea islands appear to
prosper and be contented in both fresh and salt
water.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="dcaption">THE HOME OF THE CROCODILE,
BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The natives seldom hunt them, and do not hold
them in fear. They will even bathe in a river
known to be frequented by them. Whereas in
Queensland rivers no sensible man would dream of
such a thing, his life would not be worth more than
the first two strokes. The crocodiles there are of
a far more ferocious disposition, and have been
known to chase men a considerable distance on
land, while such a thing has never been heard of in
these islands.</p>

<p>Beyond these few forms of sport there is nothing to attract the
tourist sportsman to the Solomons, as the country is devoid of all
other animals worthy of the chase, and the fishing is such that
any island far nearer and less dangerous will supply; but being in
these quarters these few sports help to pass the time, and give
one opportunities of seeing the bush at its best. Its grandeur
cannot be appreciated unless one gets right into it, and feels its
solitude and silence, then and then only does the bush speak and show
itself.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3herein">CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p class="psynopsis">A curious religion—Burying the dead, and some
graveyards—Dancers and music—Native artists, and how fire is made.</p>

<p class="pfirst">To try and discover the actual religious beliefs
of a savage race is even more difficult than attempting the same
experiment on the religion of any particular European sect. It is
almost impossible to find two people agreeing consistently on even the
main principles. Exactly the same trouble exists in savage races; if
you are lucky enough to discover a principle you will immediately get
a dozen different interpretations of it, and only where a sect follows
implicitly the ruling of one leader, and does not question or argue
against his teachings, can you gain any knowledge worth the trouble
and time you may expend on it; but in these cases I have found that
neither reason nor understanding play any part in the belief, and it
therefore lacks interest. But, strange to say, throughout the savage
and civilised races there seems to be a belief in a <span class="xxpn"
id="p125">{125}</span> heaven and a hell. These two ideas, though
varying in detail, are world wide, but notions of the way to get there,
however, differ considerably.</p>

<p>The Solomon islanders nearly all believe that when
a man or woman dies he goes to live with a good
spirit (<i>nito drekona</i>) in a far off but pleasant land,
where his companions will be as good as he is, or
nearly so. The bad man, so judged by his companions,
goes to a place of fire, the abode of the
Evil One (<i>nito paitena</i>), where he has anything but
a happy time. During his existence there he does
his best to make things unpleasant for the friends
he has left behind him, by becoming one of the
many evil spirits who are supposed to do harm to
the living.</p>

<p>To obtain any further information on this subject
is extremely difficult, and, as in other races,
each man and woman has a different idea of the
future state, some of which are particularly quaint.
The Solomon islander’s idea of a heavenly condition
would be anything but heavenly to us, in fact
some of our worst ideas of the other place would
pale before their crude notions of heaven.</p>

<p>Another fancy they all seem to hold is that
the spirits of the departed return to earth, some
as fireflies, and some as birds,
etc. They all <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
believe that the Supreme Spirit is the embodiment
of good, and yet in the same breath they will tell
you that He becomes angry and needs that His
anger should be appeased either by incantations
or the sacrifice of human beings.</p>

<p>On the death of a chief, a great personage, male
or female, universal mourning is adopted, accompanied
by feasting, which they believe helps the
spirit on its journey to the better land—for all
great people and chiefs go there direct, a fact
about which they seem to deplore, as they will
talk of the departed one as the “poor chief.” The
names of the dead are held in great reverence, and
in some islands they are never mentioned except
under the breath, or in the greatest secrecy.</p>

<p>Funeral rites differ a good deal on the various
islands, but the most common ones constitute a
feast which is celebrated when a powerful personage
dies. Directly the news of his death is announced
the natives of his tribe set about procuring a supply
of food, and calling together all the natives, and
then they commence the feast, which is followed by
a dance and the last rites peculiar to these islands.</p>

<div class="dcaption">A SHRINE OR TOMB OF A CHIEF, AT
SIMBO, SOLOMON ISLANDS</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>Most of the ceremonies take place round the
house of the departed one, who is laid out and
covered with leaves; subsequently his head
is cut off <span class="xxpn" id="p127">{127}</span>
and prepared in the approved style, which is either
by placing it in the bush near an ant-hill until all
the flesh is eaten off, or skinning it and afterwards
scraping it. This last horrible act is enjoyed by
the lucky native who is chosen to do it. After
this the skull is bleached to a perfect whiteness and
adorned with rings, which represent the chief’s
worldly possessions, and are bound to the skull by
a kind of flax. Thus prepared the head is placed
in a head house.</p>

<p>At Simbo there is a regular graveyard of these
houses just above the beach, a mile from the
trader’s house. It looks horrible, but is rather
interesting. It consists of about a dozen small huts
built on poles, some three or four feet from the
ground; in each of these are the heads of important
men. Those in front are elaborately decorated
with rings, whilst those at the back are bare.
Most of the houses contain about a dozen heads,
but one, rather larger than the others, contains
more, and is partly built of stone, the front
being barred like a rabbit hutch. This contains
the heads of the chiefs only, and is looked upon
with great reverence by the natives.</p>

<p>Luckily this weird cemetery is hidden by the
dense bush which grows almost to
the water’s edge, <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span>
or visitors, unaccustomed to such sights, might
receive a ghastly shock, as a more uncanny spectacle
to come across on a moonlight night than these
hutches, with white skulls staring vacantly through
the bars, cannot be realised. At the back of them
is the heavy dark bush, and before them the rocks
and the sea.</p>

<p>The women play the part of the chief mourners,
and show their grief by plastering their faces with
lime and chanting melancholy dirges. The men in
many parts shave their heads, some completely,
some only partially, but all cover their faces with
lime.</p>

<p>The funeral dance which follows the feast in
the Solomon Islands differs considerably from the
dances in the other islands for the same occasion.
A double circle of women is formed round four
posts, between which other women sit holding in
their arms the possessions of the departed one.
Round these the dancers gather, and with slow,
measured steps, timed to the tune of a beating
drum, they keep up an unearthly row with their
feet. Whilst these are marking time, the others
and younger ones, bearing the possessions, dance
round the inner circle and skip in and out of the
posts, always keeping in time with
the beating of <span class="xxpn" id="p129">{129}</span>
the drum. It is not an interesting dance, nor is
it awe-inspiring like many others I have seen,
whilst from an artistic point of view it falls very
short.</p>

<p>There are many others in which both men
and women take part, but none particularly interesting.
The war dance is done in crouching movements,
and should look impressive when carried
out by a well-trained crowd, but as few travellers
have witnessed it it can only be surmised that it is
grand. It is danced by the natives bearing their
shield and spears in hand, and the performers
sing a peculiar droning song during the ceremony.
The words of it, and two other native songs, were
given in a paper before the Anthropological Institute
by Lieutenant Boyle T. Somerville, R.N.

<p>These Solomon Island natives appear to have
fairly good ears for music, and have many popular
tunes and songs besides those quoted above. The
majority of them have only a few words and a
simple air, but the singers make the most of them
by repetition, so that what appears to be a long
song or tune is often quite short, and contains only
a few lines as in the above instance.</p>

<p>The Jew’s-harp has become very popular on
these islands, and both men and boys become
accomplished players on it. The native instrument
of the same class is made from a piece of bamboo
with a narrow groove cut out of the centre about
six inches long. A string is passed over the groove,
or tongue, and the end is placed against the mouth,
and the sound is produced by jerking the string
to make it vibrate.</p>

<p>The Pandean pipe, which is made on the same
principle as the classic pipe of that name, is of
native origin, and it is composed of short, hollow
lengths of bamboo lashed together with vegetable
fibre. Attached to the ends of each pipe are
streamers of the same substance.</p>

<div class="dcaption">SOLOMON ISLANDER PLAYING THE
“IVIVU,” OR FLUTE

<div>This instrument, when played by a native, has a very
sweet tone.</div></div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The native flute (<i>Ivivu</i>) is composed of a thick
piece of bamboo nearly three feet long, hollowed
out but closed at each end. It
contains four holes. <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span>
The first one is about five inches from the top
and is made for the mouth of the player. At a
distance of another five inches is another hole for
the first finger of the right hand, and the remaining
two holes are at the far end separated by a few
inches. The tone obtained from this peculiar instrument
is not at all unpleasant.</p>

<p>They possess still another instrument, known in
England as the mouth fiddle, which is roughly made
of a bent stick and has two strings. The player
holds one end of it between his teeth and manipulates
the strings with his fingers after the style
of a big Jew’s-harp.</p>

<p>Besides their musical accomplishments the
natives are very fair draughtsmen, and some of
their drawings are surprisingly good. Shark fishing,
head-hunting, and scenes of murder, are
amongst their favourite pictures. The frigate
birds and human heads figure in nearly all their
designs—especially the former, which are fish-hawks
as large as big seagulls, but somewhat darker
in plumage. When soaring overhead in search of
prey to swoop down on, the frigate bird shows the
peculiar shape of its wings, which, roughly speaking,
form the letter “M.” Like the shark it is more or less
sacred, and therefore not eaten
and seldom harmed. <span class="xxpn" id="p132">{132}</span></p>

<p>All the drawings are done on wood with a red-hot stick,
in much the same way as poker-work is
done in England. There is no particular shape or
size or even design in the instruments used for
drawing. Nowadays the natives beg a little iron
or wire, which they make red hot and go to work
with to burn out their designs.</p>

<p>Fire was produced in the old days, and still
is in the bush, by rubbing two pieces of wood
together. One is a flat piece in which a small
groove has been made, and the other is a stick
pointed at the end. The operator holds the stick
in his two hands and rubs steadily up and down
in the groove. This rubbing makes a small powder
collect in the end of the groove, and after a few
minutes it begins to smoulder, and, finally, with
the aid of gentle blowing, it ignites sufficiently
for other dry wood to be lighted by it.</p>

<p>Wax matches and magnifying glasses have
quite superseded this method in the shore villages,
and as traders get farther into the country, native
fire producing will die out, as many other customs
have done and are doing daily.</p>

<p>The making of war weapons is already on the
wane, and old Winchesters and modern rifles are
quickly taking their places.
Even for hunting <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span>
purposes the natives prefer to purchase a weapon,
rather than go to the trouble of making one. The
only sort of war weapon to be seen to-day is a
composition of the English axe-head, sold by
the traders, mounted on a handle of native
manufacture. These are crude but useful, and
are as a rule well carved.</p>

<p>The bow and arrow are in pretty general use in
the Solomon Islands, though they are not seen so
often in New Georgia. In Bougainville and St.
Christoval bows and arrows are used for all hunting
purposes. Spears and clubs form their other
weapons; the spears are not poisoned, only a few
have barbs on them, and the majority are made
with hard wood points. Bougainville supplies most
of the specimens showing barbs. The clubs used
in St. Christoval rather resemble in shape an
Australian boomerang with a straight handle.
Other clubs belonging to different islands are of
the policeman’s truncheon order.</p>

<p>Shields are also carried, and are made generally on a bamboo frame
lashed together with native string and thatched. They are between three
and four feet long and one foot broad.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3herein">CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p class="psynopsis">What “hope” is to the Solomon islander—The use of
the evil eye.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Sacred places in the Solomons are called hope, the
word being used in very much the same way as <i>tapu</i> (taboo) is by the
Maoris of New Zealand, and other savage races, but, unlike the Maoris,
the Solomon islanders use “hope” to keep a place free from trespassers;
thus if a native has a cocoa-nut grove or a yam patch he erects a
“hope,” and so prevents any other native from going to it.</p>

<p>It is a strange custom and difficult to fathom,
but the belief in it is so strong that the most daring
native would not dream of testing its powers. There
are various kinds of “hopes,” some will result in the
death of any one trespassing on them, whilst others
will only bring sickness upon him. A death “hope”
will have a skull on it, or a piece of shell, or part of
an ant’s nest, and on seeing these signs the intruder
knows what to expect—that he will die
as the man <span class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span>
has died whose skull is there, or die as surely as the
fish which once lived in the shell has died, or as
the ants which inhabited the nest. A “hope” in
which coral takes the place of the above objects
announces sickness to the trespasser.</p>

<p>A chief’s house and the grounds adjoining it
are nearly always “hope,” and only his wives are
allowed to go into them, other intruders will either
die or fall sick. Certain animals and places are
also “hope,” and little altars are built on some
of the small islands which make them sacred. In
fact, “hope” is a most extraordinary thing and can
be used in the most eccentric ways. I heard of
one place which was once “hope,” and yet had the
“hope” taken away from it for no particular
reason. Then, again, crocodiles are in some parts
“hope” and are not allowed to be killed; but in
one of the rivers where crocodiles abound a youth
was killed by them, and the chief took the “hope”
off until the boy’s father had slain a sufficient
number to satisfy his anger, and then back went the
“hope.”</p>

<p>Another kind of “hope” was seen by Lieutenant
B. T. Somerville, and was made by putting a festoon
of a certain creeper across the entrance to a cocoa-nut
grove, with pieces of the same
material along it <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span>
at regular intervals, hanging perpendicularly downwards
and secured to the ground. “I had two
natives with me at the time,” he states, “and at first
they did not like to land on the islet bearing this
mark as it had been ‘hoped’ by their chief, Bera.
They did land eventually, however, and one of them
went under the hope barricade, picked the central
tiny shoot of a large fern—in appearance like the
English hart’s-tongue fern—from which he nibbled
a little bit, and then handed it to the other man
who did the same. They assured me that now the
hope would have no effect as long as they did not
steal any nuts.”</p>

<p>There seem to be various methods of overcoming
“hope,” the chief being by a payment to
the owner of it. He will extort what he considers a
sufficiently large sum of money to take away the ill
effects which would otherwise have followed if the
“hope” had been scouted. “Hope” altars are also
built in various parts of the bush as a means of
warding off certain evil spirits. On these food and
other things are placed, such as broken pots, shells,
old pipes, and worn-out musical instruments, and
the evil spirit dare not come near them.</p>

<div class="dcaption">A TAPU VIRGIN, BRITISH SOLOMON
ISLANDS

<p class="pfirst">At the launching of a new war canoe in New Georgia,
two virgins are taken from the tribe; one is publicly sacrificed, and
the other kept in seclusion from four to five years. During this time
an old woman acts as guard over her. Should she break the tabu she is
put to death. The skulls on the sticks are a sign to all that if they
molest her their heads will be stuck up in the same way. The object in
the background is a skull-box; the large necklace is of dogs’ teeth,
and the small necklet of spiral shell ground down; the ear-rings of
pieces of Tredacua.</p></div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>In spite of the fact that the white men scorn these “hopes” and do
not suffer any bad results, <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span>
it has in no way brought discredit on them; the belief is quite as
strong now as it ever was, but the natives think that the white man is
guarded by a special providence and so cling to their belief.</p>

<p>There are many peculiar legends relating to
monsters living in certain parts of the bush country
and on certain mountains and islands. One tells of
an enormous clam-shell which lives on the summit
of Vonggi, a mountain some sixteen hundred feet
high covered to the top with thick bush. If any
native ventured near it the clam-shell would kill
and eat him.</p>

<p>Superstition and ancient custom make up the
chief characteristics of these natives, and though
civilisation has made some difference in their mode
of living, they have not marched with the times as
the natives of some of the adjoining islands have.
The men still think it their duty to be ready for
attacks and leave their wives to do the work, and
though the chances of sudden attack have practically
ceased and left them without employment, they
have not taken up fresh work. Even the natives
who have returned from the sugar plantations of
Queensland, after their three years’ service, do not
endeavour to instil new ideas into their fraternity
by example. They simply throw off
all signs of <span class="xxpn" id="p138">{138}</span>
civilisation and become as the others are, or if
anything lazier, but to these men and their term
of service in Australia I will devote a portion of
the next chapter. It is no doubt owing to the
old days of slave traffic, or black-birding as it was
called, that the natives here are shy and backward.</p>

<p>Dr. Guppy mentions a peculiar incident relating
to the superstitions of the Solomon islanders
regarding the power of thinking evil of a person
and so bringing disaster upon him. He says that
when the natives cut off locks of their hair for
him, which he desired for scientific purposes, they
told him that if any sickness or calamity befell
them they would put it down to him.</p>

<p>The fear of evil wishing is very strong amongst
them, and when they are in mourning, and so have
to shave their heads, they bury the hair in order
to prevent enemies getting hold of it. Thought
transference is no speculative theory with them,
and they have the most unbounded faith in its
power where evil is concerned, but very few seem
to think it can be used for good. They also
imagine that certain people possess an evil eye or
can conjure it up on occasions. They often put
down the death of a chief to an evil eye having
been cast on him. This sometimes
results in an <span class="xxpn" id="p139">{139}</span>
unfortunate creature being picked out and killed
through suspicion having fallen on him or her.
At other times, when the supposed culprit has not
been found, a terrible panic has taken place and
the whole village has been deserted and a new one
built. The old village then becomes “hope,” and
no amount of persuasion will induce the tribe to
go back and settle in it, unless, as in one or two
cases, the “hope” is removed by some great chief
or medicine man.</p>

<p>Medicine men here, as in most other places, hold unique positions,
and many a smart villain prospers owing to the belief that he has power
over the unseen—to kill or cure at will. Their houses are taboo or
“hope,” the same as a chief’s, and in many villages they are held in
far greater awe than the chief himself.</p></div><!--section-->

ISLAND, NEW HEBRIDES</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section" id="p143">
<h3 class="h3herein">CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p class="psynopsis">Islands that are advancing rapidly—Native houses
with modern improvements—A horrible method of getting rid of the old
men, and other burial ceremonies.</p>

<p class="pfirst">There is a remarkable difference between the natives
of the New Hebrides group and any of the inhabitants of the adjoining
islands. In character, disposition, mode of living and religion, they
are in many respects far ahead of their neighbours, and, strange to
say, so are the islands. The soil is better and the climate is more to
the liking of the European, and, owing to the proximity of the islands
to Sydney, they are better served and more up-to-date. Port Vila in
Sandwich Island, the chief centre, is only five days’ sail from that
city.</p>

<p>Settlement in the New Hebrides has been going
on for some time, and the white population has
nearly doubled itself within the last few years.
In 1901, the French residents and traders far out-numbered
the English, but to-day
another tale is <span class="xxpn" id="p144">{144}</span>
told, and British enterprise and power of colonisation
have made a difference in this group; so much
so that they are hardly recognisable, and they only
need careful legislation to enable them to overcome
the obstacles mentioned earlier in this book.</p>

<p>Where dense, uncleared bush grew a few years
ago in tangled confusion, blocking out even the
light by its thickness, acres of cultivated ground can
now be seen, which bring to their owners results
worthy of twice the toil that has been expended
on them.</p>

<p>The Hebrides is a veritable paradise for the
pioneer settler who loves the wild freedom of
island life and is not afraid of work.</p>

<p>A good deal of the prosperity of these islands
is undoubtedly owing to the strenuous efforts of
the missionaries, the Australian Government, and
that gigantic trading firm of Messrs. Burns Philp,
who have established a monthly service of steamers,
which call at all the important islands to deliver
and take away produce. Throughout the South
Seas they have trading stations, but in New
Hebrides their success has met with better returns
than elsewhere, owing to the greater number of
settlers who have gone there and made their homes
in these beautiful islands.</p>

<div class="dcaption">THE RAPIDS, WILLIAMS RIVER, ISLAND
OF EROMANGA, NEW HEBRIDES</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<div class="dxxpn" id="p145">{145}</div>

<p>The chief industry is, as in the Solomon Islands,
copra, but coffee, maize, tobacco, bananas, pineapples,
and many other tropical products, are being
cultivated successfully, and each year shows some
new advance in agriculture; it is safe to say that
before long these islands will not be far behind the
West Indies.</p>

<p>Another feature that has assisted the prosperity
of this group is the fact that those natives who
have served their three years on the plantations in
Queensland have not gone back to idleness, as the
Solomon islanders have, but, in the majority of
cases, have set to work on a patch of ground of
their own, from which they have earned good
money and so have assisted the prosperity of their
country.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that with all these changes
the ancient customs of the natives are fast dying
out, which in some cases is rather sad; but, as may
be supposed, in others it is a good thing, and the
sooner their worst ceremony, that of burying the
old men alive, is wiped out the better.</p>

<p>Even to-day, in Malekula, this custom, which
has prevailed evidently since the beginning of the
race, is only kept alive by the old men; the
younger ones show an absolute
distaste for it. <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span>
Directly a man or woman shows signs of decrepitude
or helplessness, those who are nearest to that
stage themselves tell him that his time has come,
and that his burial will take place on such and
such a date.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the day, the grave for the
intended victim is dug, and, in front of a large
crowd, the old man is led or carried to it—if he
be too weak to get into it himself. He is then
stretched out at full length, and, whilst incantations
are sung, the earth is thrown over him, and willing
hands soon have the ground level and solid above
him, and the old man is left there to die. The
spectators of this ghastly scene then adjourn to a
feast, which is to many of them the most important
part of the ceremony.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dcaption">MOUNT MARION, THE ACTIVE VOLCANO,
ISLAND OF AMBRYN, NEW HEBRIDES</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>In some cases the buried man has had sufficient
strength left in him to upheave the earth and rise
out of his grave, and has even attempted to join the
feast, but he has been still considered dead, and no
one has given him food. If he be strong enough
and can obtain food for himself, he is buried again
and again, until at last he has to die from pure
exhaustion, if nothing else. Should, however, a
very tough customer be met with, and it is found
that he refuses to die, and each time
gets out of <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span>
his grave, he is strangled before being buried again;
for once his death sentence has been passed it
must be carried out—he is a dead man from that
hour and nothing can save him. I may add that
directly the man is buried his property is divided
amongst the villagers, so that if he were allowed
to come back he would be a homeless wanderer,
and no one would have anything to do with him.</p>

<p>In deference to the other islands it is only
fair to state that Malekula is the most savage one
of the group. From a missionary point of view
the island of Tanna is perhaps the worst, as it is
stated that, after sixty years of labour on this island,
the converts to Christianity can all be counted on
the fingers of two hands.</p>

<p>Aoba and Sandwich Islands are both beautiful
spots and more favoured than any of the other
islands, when beautiful scenery is required. There
are two fine volcanoes, which add considerably to
the interest of the New Hebrides. One of them
is at Ambryn, which almost rivals Etna, and is
generally belching forth fire and fumes and now
and then a heavy stream of lava, which makes it
somewhat dangerous—as was proved not a dozen
years ago by an eruption there which played
havoc with the place, absolutely
destroyed a whole <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span>
village, and discoloured the sea for miles round.
The roar of the other one at Tanna can be heard
quite distinctly at Port Resolution. One of the
peculiarities is that an eruption occurs systematically
every five minutes, though it is not a bad
one. The walk to the volcano through the dense
forest from Port Resolution is very beautiful, and
if one keeps on the weather side of it, so as to
avoid the fumes, a more enjoyable half-hour’s climb
cannot be found. On reaching the top the full
view of the enormous chasm is appalling, and
the rugged, torn, and blistered sides, the curling
smoke and fumes, and the great gulf, present
a picture rivalling our worst ideas of the lower
regions. The explosion which shakes the whole
mountain puts a finishing touch to the scene.</p>

<p>In spite of their more civilised condition the New
Hebrides natives are intensely interesting, owing
to the fact that they can speak English, and like
to boast about their acquaintance with Englishmen
in Queensland, and therefore think it necessary to
speak the English language to show they have
been there. This enables a visitor to get information
regarding their customs and ceremonies much
more easily than in the other groups.</p>

<p class="pfirst">In
the foreground are seated two men, the one on
the left with a bow. The women behind them have
their heads shaved in the usual way, with only a
mane down the top of the head. On the ground are
ordinary native pots. The long poles in the thatch
are for the purpose of keeping it from being blown
off, and the poles in front are a defence against pigs
and dogs, one of which is seen coming round the
corner.</p></div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The natives themselves, taking them
as a whole, <span class="xxpn" id="p149">{149}</span>
are better built and of a more striking appearance
than those of the Solomon Islands. They resemble
more nearly the Fijian type than any of the inhabitants
of the sister islands.</p>

<p>A peculiarity most noticeable in the villages is
that there is greater cleanliness and order; the
houses are mostly built in groups of four or five, and
are low, broad, barn-like huts in which you have to
climb up a few feet and down again in order to gain
admittance to the living rooms. They are built
on the ground and not on piles, and each group
is surrounded by a coral wall on which are stuck
long bamboo canes. These take root immediately,
as the wall is built when the coral is soft, and
present an interesting sight. The bamboo canes
form a fine high fence, which, unfortunately, in time
totally obscures the houses.</p>

<p>A gap in the wall is left for the residents of these
queer compounds to pass backwards and forwards.
Between the houses and the wall a large cleared
space is left where the pigs, the dogs, and the
babies play.</p>

<p>The interiors of the houses are not quite as
pleasant or artistic. The whole place inside is
blackened with smoke and soot, owing to the
smoke from the fire having no
proper outlet. The <span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span>
fire is usually lit as near the door as possible, but as
the doors are very low the smoke has first to fill
the room before it finds its way out. The thatch
being thicker than is usual there is very little
room for escape in that quarter. Bamboo is used
chiefly to build the frames on which to thatch
the grass. Forked sticks of a stouter material
bear the main weight of the roof, flimsy bamboo
canes are bent right over the ridge pole about six
inches apart, and secured to another stout pole
near the ground, lathes are then run across the
bamboo and lashed to them with fibre, and on this
framework the outside of the house is made.</p>

<p>The floors are covered with mats on which the
natives squat by day and sleep at night. Screen
mats also divide the interiors of the huts and cut
off the sleeping apartments. A few cooking
utensils and worn-out, soot-begrimed weapons are
generally to be seen lying about, but beyond these
articles and the natives themselves, nothing else
takes up any room in these dark abodes.</p>

<p>Each island has its own particular way of building
a house, and those in Malekula are perhaps
the best and most modern. Light is admitted
to them through a window at the back, which is
boarded up at night or
in rough weather.</p>

<div class="dcaption">CHIEF’S HOUSE, AMBRYN, NEW HEBRIDES

<p class="pfirst">Round these houses are dry-built stone or coral
walls. I saw more huts on this island encompassed in this way than
on any other. The large shell hanging from the pole is a sign of a
tapu.</p></div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<div class="dxxpn" id="p151">{151}</div>

<p>The usual custom of natives to build near a
fresh-water stream is not carried out in the New
Hebrides; they seem to object to fresh water and
seldom, if ever, drink it.</p>

<p>Occasionally they bathe in the sea; but here
again they show a marked difference to the other
islanders, for they seldom swim except when
necessity compels them to do so, and so averse are
they to water that they will actually walk an extra
half-mile to avoid having to wade or swim through
a creek.</p>

<p>The sanitary arrangements of the village are, of
course, conspicuous by their absence, and were
it not for the crowd of dogs, pigs, and fowls, no
visitor could go near them. The work of the
missionaries, however, has done much to improve
the home life of the natives, and in many villages
their influence shows itself in the better construction
of the houses and the greater neatness of the
villagers; and much as the searcher after “original
conditions” might object to these improvements,
he must declare that from an artistic point of
view, if from no other, these villages surpass those
where the missionaries have not been able to make
headway.</p>

<p>The blending of savage
ideas and European <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span>
methods makes a quaint and interesting picture.
A thatched squat native house with a neat coral
path is infinitely better than the muddy, sloppy
places of the past, and a hut where one can see
when inside it, and where one is not blinded by
the smoking fire, is surely much better than one
in its native condition, smoke-begrimed and smelling,
however natural its former condition was.</p>

<p>The tambu houses are more carefully constructed
here, and are thatched with banana leaves.
They are of course much bigger than the living
houses, and are to be seen close to the dancing
grounds in each place. In them are kept all the
accessories to the dances, for dancing plays a more
important part in the life of the New Hebridean
than it does elsewhere, and very elaborate grounds,
houses, and regalias are used. But this side of
the life we will leave for another chapter, as to
understand it a further insight into their other
ceremonies is necessary.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3herein">CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p class="psynopsis">Ancestor worship the religion of the New
Hebrides—Temples and strange figures, and some sacred dances.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Ancestor worship was undoubtedly the original
religion of the New Hebrideans, and in many islands the present form
of worship is based upon it. According to Mr. Macdonald, a resident in
Exate, the followers of it believe that after death the soul passes
through six stages before it finally dies. When its earthly life is
over it goes to the gate of Hades, which is situated at Tukitaki,
at the western extremity of the island. Here it meets Seritan the
cannibal executioner, and his two assistants Vanas and Maxi. Certain
questions are then put by them to the soul, and if it does not answer
them satisfactorily it is passed on to Maseasi, who cuts out its
tongue, splits its head open, and twists it back. If the questions
asked by these officials at the gate are well answered, then the <span
class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span> soul is permitted to go on in
peace through its various stages.</p>

<p>Seritan in olden days was a noted cannibal
chief, hence his work now in Hades seems particularly
suitable to his past experience. This idea of
the hereafter has a faint resemblance to the Maori
beliefs; they hold that there are certain stages to
be gone through, and the same belief of questions
being asked is adhered to—though their final end,
if they be worthy men and true, is not annihilation,
as far as I could gather from the older chiefs, but a
life of pleasure.</p>

<p>The trouble is, however, that they have undoubtedly
got their ideas mixed up—a fault one
finds with nearly all the savage races of to-day.</p>

<p>In Efaté there are certain classes of people who
are allowed to pass unquestioned into Hades—those
belonging to the Namtaku tribe, and others who
have certain figures carved on their bodies. Why
they don’t all go through this operation and escape
the chance of having their necks broken is a mystery,
but they are not the only believers in certain
religious rites who do not bother about testing
them.</p>

<div class="dcaption">THE “M’AKI” GROUND AND THE JAWS
OF THE SACRED PIGS, NEW HEBRIDES</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>Modifications of the above belief are also held
in other islands, and in Malekula
it is supposed <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span>
that three stages only are gone through before the
perfect spiritual condition is reached, and that the
soul then fades away into nothingness.</p>

<p>The sacred men of these islands will tell you
that they periodically visit the first stopping-place
of the departed souls, and they say it is a long way
under the ground. In this place all the important
affairs of the world are discussed and arranged, and
it is from here that the spirits work and punish
those who do not follow the dictates of the sacred
men. These priests or sacred men in this way have
gained a tremendous control over their fellow-men,
for superstition is strong and no native dare disobey
a sacred man.</p>

<p>Sacrifices of pig and other foods have to be made
to inhabitants of the under world, and feasts are laid
out for them, which they are supposed to devour
when no one is near—a spiritual feast, so spiritual,
indeed, that none but those who believe in these
things can see the slightest signs of any of the food
having been touched. Such incredulity, however,
has no effect on the natives, they look at you in a
pitying way when you infer that the food has not
been touched—such is belief.</p>

<p>In connection with their religion certain peculiarly
shaped stones are
denominated sacred and <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span>
are said to contain the spirits of departed relatives.
In the case of a chief the stone is placed in a hut to
preserve it from rough weather, and round it are
arranged effigies of the chief, and perhaps of one
or two of his nearest relations.</p>

<p>These images, or demits as they are called, are
ghastly looking things, and when one comes suddenly
up against them their full horror is apparent. After
death the chief is decapitated and the skull is cleaned
and bleached, and then, with a preparation of clay
and fibre, a face representing his, as it was while he
was alive, is modelled on the bare skull; his peculiarities
in feature are emphasised to a degree bordering

<div class="dcaption">A MEMORIAL EFFIGY, MALEKULA,
NEW HEBRIDES

<p class="pfirst">This figure represents a departed chief who has gone
to the under world and become a “Demit.”</p>

<p>The figure is made on a framework of wood or
bamboo, covered with clay and vegetable fibre. The
head is the real skull of the chief covered in the same
way as the body with real hair and beard; the arms,
round which are pigs’ tusks, are made from a small
plant, the root forming the hands. One of the
reasons the natives have for making figures in this
way is that the chief may still be able to look upon
his friends. At the side of the figure is a bundle of
sacred pigs’ jaws; in front is a priest.</p>
</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The body of the effigy is built up on a framework
of wood, and covered with the same preparation
of clay and fibre and modelled in a like manner,
but, as a rule, it is seriously out of proportion.
When this imitation body is finished it is coloured
in three shades, red, black, and white (sometimes
blue is found on them, but as the natives are
unable to obtain this colour naturally it is only
used where the traders can supply it). Down the
trunk of the body long stripes
are made, running <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span>
vertically or horizontally, and round the legs bands
of these alternate colours are painted. The
shoulders and knees are decorated with grotesque
faces, surmounted by tufts of fibre which often rise
to a distance of three or four inches. A bamboo
cane is stuck in each of these tufts, and on the top
of it splendid specimens of boars’ tusks are sometimes
to be seen.</p>

<p>The hands of these idols are made from the
roots of a sapling, and add to the weirdness of the
picture. Bracelets of boars’ tusks are also found
on some of these effigies.</p>

<p>Other sheds and places of worship contain
somewhat different things. The sacred stone is
guarded by nude wooden figures of men and women,
cut in the roughest style and free from ornament.
The posts holding up the shed have also elaborate
figures of strangely misshaped heads with shapeless
bodies attached.</p>

<p>But to the more important part of their religion.
In every village there is a “sing-sing” ground laid
out—this is the slang term for it, but it is
appropriate. These grounds are kept for dancing,
not the frivolous dancing of the Europeans, but a
sacred, awe-inspiring, religious ceremony. The
very idea of frivolity seems wrong in
such a place. <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
The cleared space is surrounded by a dense, dark
bush, and on the edge of the clearing high wooden
posts slanting in various directions are stuck into
the ground. These drums, for such they are, are
grotesque things, standing from four to six feet
high, with a dark slit down the centre, and a fearsome
face carved on the front; some are all face
and look like terrible nightmares, and each has
behind it a carved stone.</p>

<p>Picture yourself on one of these grounds on a
warm moonlight night, when a dance is to take
place. Dense clouds are rolling over the sky and
now and then obscuring the moon or sending fitful
shadows across the bare space; beyond is black
bush so thick that it looks like a weird inferno.
You wait and listen, and hear nothing but the roar
of the distant volcano. Presently a crowd of stark
naked natives make their appearance and take up
their position each by the side of a drum, and begin
a dull beating noise to call the dancers. In the
centre of the ground is a circle of five or six white
poles, some thirty feet long, bent and crooked and
leaning all ways.</p>

<div class="dcaption">DRUM GROVE AT MELE, NEW HEBRIDES

<p class="pfirst">These drums are made of large tree-trunks, burnt out
in the centre through the long slot down the middle; both the slot and
the round openings are sound-holes. The meaning of the designs on the
drums is unknown. A heavy round drum-stick of wood is used. Every one
of the drum-groves I have seen appeared to be haunted by an old man or
two. Round the drums the “M’AKI” ceremony takes place.</p>
</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>When deserted these “sing-sing” grounds are
uncanny enough, but on a dance night they are
worse, and when the
drumming commences, which <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span>
sounds as if it came from the bowels of the earth,
and makes the flesh of your back feel as if it wanted
to come off, the climax is reached. You become
chock-full of the supernatural, and would not be
in the least surprised if the earth opened up and
the dancers appeared amidst flames and smoke.
Nothing quite as bad does happen, but, presently,
lights are seen flashing in the bush, and dark objects
holding torches come out and calmly take up their
position in the circle, till nearly a hundred human
beings, naked save for paint and streamers, are
moving about.</p>

<p>Suddenly the drumming noise changes to a sort
of tattoo, and then a file of men line up and begin
to keep time to the drums with their feet; slowly
at first, and then faster and faster till the very earth
shakes, and the dull thudding echoes through the
dark bush. Then a savage song is heard, a low
chanting, and the men begin to whirl round and
round the posts till the eye becomes glazed and
the flickering light from the torches conjures up a
thousand things that never happen, but the drumming,
monotonous beating of those wooden images
goes on and the tapping of the feet. The crowd
of women over by the bush stand watching in
an almost hypnotic state,
their bodies swaying <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
unconsciously to the beating of the drums and the
feet—black naked women with vermilion-coloured
faces, and white, staring, rolling eyes watching every
movement of the dance. Then a sudden dying
away of the drums and the shuffling of the feet
and silence. It is weird indeed.</p>

<p>The women step forward, it is their turn now,
and a wild scene commences. More weird and
more noisy than ever. Their shrill voices, mingling
with the thumping of the drums and the gruff
monotones of the men, make the bush resound.
This is kept up for a long time, and then suddenly
they all rush off and the place is left in darkness.</p>

<p>On the morrow a big feast is held and the chief
kills the sacred pigs. The ceremony attached to
this is worth seeing, as it is one of those customs
that are so time-worn that both their significance
and original meaning are lost and only the outward
ceremony remains. For this the natives are highly
decorated with flowers and paint, and their frills
and plumes are extra well attended to. After a
few preliminary canters round the dancing ring to
drive away the evil spirits, the chief and sacred
men appear, carrying spears. To the accompaniment
of drums these worthies pirouette round the
ground. When this exercise is finished
a band of <span class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span>
natives face them and sing a wild song. Girls next
appear before the chief, highly be-plumed and be-feathered
and with faces stained bright red. They
in their turn dance and sing. Next comes the
procession composed of men only, who carry the
pig, which, like Paddy’s, has a string tied to its leg
in case it tries to get away. The procession goes
round the whole circle while the drums are beaten
in a quick tattoo—the squeals of the pig do not in
the least affect these stolid drummers, who ever
keep time and never smile. At last, when the
circle is complete, the pig is cast at the feet of the
chief, who spears it with much gusto and then
flings the spear away. The pig is sometimes
properly killed afterwards, but it is not considered
necessary. It is then carried away to where the
spear, thrown by the chief, has fallen. This is the
way the pig is sacrificed to the sacred stone. Each
stone has to have its pig, so the killing goes on
until the right number has been slain. Then comes
the cooking of all the dead and dying grunters, and
the biggest feast of the season is commenced. So
fat is the feast that at least half-a-dozen of those
taking part in it have to be removed and rubbed
down by their comrades, or the women-folk, to
save them from
death from over-gorging. <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span></p>

<p>There are many other ways of performing these
dance and pig ceremonies, and each island, in fact
each village, varies the performance, but they all
begin with a dance and end with a feast, which is
the usual programme for savage functions.</p>

<h3 class="h3herein">CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p class="psynopsis">Concerning witchcraft—More about burials—The
gentle art of making love—The rain-makers.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Superstition and witchcraft are strongly in evidence
in the New Hebrideans, and the natives have more than their share of
both. Besides those things to which I have already alluded, there is
a peculiar idea held in some of the islands that certain sacred men
have the power of killing by witchcraft. The method adopted by them is
similar in many respects to the usual custom, that of making an image
of the man or woman whose death is required, and then doing to it what
it is wished shall happen to the original. In the island of Tanna the
method differs slightly, for here, instead of an image being made, part
of the person’s property is stolen and taken to the sacred man who
works destruction to its late owner, but he must have this property
in his possession, or his maledictions will fail. <span class="xxpn"
id="p164">{164}</span></p>

<p>The sacred men who are supposed to possess
these powers are called Narak-burners, and they
hold their position through being the possessors of
certain stones known as Narak stones, which they,
or their fathers, have at some time found and
buried in the vicinity of their house. Some of
these stones are in the British Museum and show
no signs of anything supernatural about them,
but the natives hold them in great dread and
reverence.</p>

<p>When a man desires the death of any one, he
visits the Narak—he may only desire to give
him a disease, but it is usually death he is
after when calling on the Narak-burner—and
brings with him some hair or food or some particle
of clothing belonging to the man he wishes shall
suffer. This he presents to the Narak, who doctors
it up and then wraps it in leaves and burns it over
a sacred fire, lit, it is presumed, over or near the
place where the Narak stones are hidden. As
the article begins to burn, so sickness falls
upon the owner, who goes on getting worse until
the article is completely turned to ashes; then
death comes.</p>

<div class="dcaption">A SACRED MAN, AOBA, NEW HEBRIDES
</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>Such is the superstition, but of its power I
cannot speak. A large
payment of shell-money <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
or pigs has to be made to the Narak-burner before
he starts his work, and if a man hears that his
effigy is being thus dealt with, or fancies it is
because he feels sick, he will hurry off to the
“burner” and offer him a bigger price for his
freedom than his enemy has paid for his death.
The result of this may be guessed, and a keen
bidding often results; if he be rich he is allowed to
live, but a poor man has no chance.</p>

<p>It is through the fear of Narak burning and evil
wishing that the natives bury their hair when they
cut it off, and also take care never to leave any
half-finished food about. They throw all their
refuse into a stream of water, which it is believed
removes the power of the Narak-burner.</p>

<p>There are so many quaint ceremonies connected
with the lives of these natives that a whole volume
might be devoted to them alone; and even then
to deal with them all thoroughly the volume would
have to be a big one. In this book I only intend
touching on the outskirts of those which affect
their lives most closely, and even then many of the
details must be left out, partly because they can
only be explained in a scientific work, and partly
because they are so intricate. The whys and the
wherefores would lead
into endless paths. <span class="xxpn" id="p166">{166}</span></p>

<p>If a native is rich, the first way he shows it is
by changing his name, and, as in England, money
has to be spent for this privilege; in the New
Hebrides it means a feast, and a big one at that.
On announcing his desire for a new name to the
chief, and proving that he has the means of paying
for it, the native goes away by himself for a few
weeks, during which time he is considered “duli”
and is not allowed to see a woman, and only permitted
to eat certain things, as in the case of the
New Guinea natives when they become <i>ibito</i>.</p>

<p>After his seclusion he is known by his new
name, and attends the big religious feast which he
himself has provided.</p>

<p>Other ways are found for changing names, and
certain natives are rewarded for their bravery and
good deeds by being given a new one, in much the
same way as a man is knighted in England.</p>

<p>The marriage laws are similar to those in the
other islands; and pigs are often given to the
parents in exchange for their daughter. The girl
being chosen more often for her working capabilities
than for her beauty.</p>

<p>The burial ceremony and disposal of the corpse
vary considerably in the different islands, but since
the introduction of Christianity
they are changing <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span>
to the ordinary Christian burial. In <i>Oceania</i> the
author says that in old days “In Efaté the body
was carefully prepared for burial and then dressed.
The burial was accompanied with much solemnity,
and great wailing, and animals were slain in sacrifice
to the dead at the grave. It was supposed that
the spirits or essence of the animals slain would
accompany the souls of the deceased to the spirit-world,
the entrance to which was the westermost
point of Efaté, at a place called Takituki.”</p>

<p>“In Malekula,” says Lieutenant Boyle T.
Somerville, “a sort of mummy is made, of which
specimens were brought to his ship by a white
trader, who had procured them in exchange for a
rifle at the conclusion of a ‘sing-sing.’ They are
said to be the effigies of the chief, whose skull (the
only portion retained of all his remains) formed
the head. This is plastered with mud to represent
a living face, a body of bamboo twigs and
mud, highly coloured in black, white and red and
purple stripes, forms the figure. On each shoulder
a highly conventional face is moulded, looking
to right and left respectively, and in each hand is
a pig’s lower jaw.”</p>

<p>During Mr. Hardy’s travels in these islands, he
came across a kind of graveyard
where chiefs were <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
supposed to be buried underground, and a heap of
stones and rocks marked the spots where they lay.</p>

<p>The skull-huts, already alluded to, show that
this is still another form of burial—they are innumerable.</p>

<p>Rain-making is almost as universal as feeding,
and every race has its rain-maker, who, for a consideration,
will tap the cloudless sky and bring
torrents of water down to quench the thirst of the
dry earth. In the New Hebrides the rain-maker
goes into the forest and there collects the branches
of a certain tree, which he cuts into lengths and
lays a dozen or so of them parallel to each other.
He then takes another dozen and threads them
through the parallel ones, forming a kind of flat
basket-work hurdle. Over this contrivance he
mutters prayers, and then buries it in a dried-up
creek where the water should be running.</p>

<p>More incantations follow this proceeding, and
then heavy stones and rocks are placed over the
rain producer, and the inhabitants all wait for the
rain, which, strange to say, generally comes.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>There is no lack of faith in these natives, and
when once they have applied to the rain-maker they
set to work to make preparation for the rain, which
reminds me of an amusing anecdote
I heard in <span class="xxpn" id="p169">{169}</span>
America. In Belmont there had been a tremendous
drought, and the farmers were in such a fright that
they unanimously decided to appoint a certain day
on which rain should be prayed for. On the Sunday
chosen, the farmers, their wives, and families rose
early and started off to church. Just as one party
were leaving home a little child of five or six years
old suddenly sprang down from the buggy and cried
out for them to wait a minute, as she disappeared
into the house. Every one wondered what was
the matter, and presently, when the child appeared
carrying a great big carriage umbrella, they all
burst into roars of laughter. “Why,” said the
father, “you silly child, there’s not a cloud in
the sky.”</p>

<p>For a moment the child looked perplexed. “But,
daddy,” she said in a tone of wonder, “aren’t we
going to pray for rain?”</p>

<p>The natives of the New Hebrides are very much
like this little girl, and perhaps their faith brings
about the results they desire. Who knows? Sometimes,
however, they get more than they desire.</p>

<p>One writer gives an amusing description of what
happened in 1890, at Ambrym, an island adjoining
Malekula, when rain was asked for.</p>

<p>“Make us rain,” said the
natives to the <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span>
rain-maker, “or our yams will not grow and we shall
starve.”</p>

<p>The wise man consented, and after the machine,
described above, was duly placed in a dry water-hole,
the rain came down in torrents and did not cease
for forty-eight hours. It was so severe that the
entire surface of the harbour was fresh to the depth
of three or four inches; and the water-hole, where
the machine had been placed, had ten feet of water
in it; whilst the yams in the plantation were being
literally washed out of the ground. So great was
the consternation of the natives that they were
beside themselves with fear, and rushing to the
rain-maker implored him to stop the rain. This,
however, was no easy task, as the old man explained,
because his machine was buried under ten feet of
rushing water. Being unable to dive he could not
get it out, and until it was fished out the rain would
continue. The scene can be better pictured than
described. At last in desperation the aid of the
shore natives, who are good divers and swimmers,
was sought, and soon the machine was brought
out of the creek, and the rain stopped immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p>The most remarkable thing about these and like superstitions is that
more often than not they come <span class="xxpn" id="p171">{171}</span>
off as the sages predict they will; and when once one does there
is no longer any room for doubt, in the minds of those who wish to
believe. That incident of rain-making in 1890 will be talked about for
years, and the name of the rain-maker will be handed down to future
generations.</p></div><!--section-->

<p class="psynopsis">Native clothing and ornaments—Their arts and
industries, their canoes and weapons, and their way of fishing.</p>

<p class="pfirst">In Malekula, Efaté, and Tanna the natives wear as
many adornments and cram as many ornaments on their bodies as they can,
and since this weakness of theirs has been found out, both visitors and
missionaries trade on it, when endeavouring to get on the right side of
them. Everybody going to these places nowadays takes with him a good
supply of trumpery adornments, and exchanges them for native things
of ten times their value. Ivory rings and shell rings were the most
precious ornaments the New Hebrideans originally wore, but the less
wealthy covered themselves with armlets, fibre belts, flowers, and if
they could get a comb to stick in their hair they fancied themselves
immensely superior to those who had not such a mark of distinction.
Trade beads are now added to their possessions, and they work them into
most artistic <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{173}</span> patterns
and wear them round their necks. A small mirror will often be seen
hanging from a native’s ear-ring, and many other strange combinations
of savagedom mixed with civilisation are met with in these islands
to-day. A native wearing a calico loin-cloth and a top-hat poised on
his woolly head and kept in position by a string round his chin is not
an uncommon sight. Another may be seen wearing a pair of knee-breeches,
a tennis shirt, with the collar turned up, and a trader’s hat. Another,
perhaps dispensing with the breeches, will wear only the hat and shirt.
Altogether they seem to do their very best to imitate an English clown,
though of course they are not aware of the fact.</p>

<div class="dcaption">OLD CANNIBAL CHIEF WHOM THE
ARTIST MET ON THE ISLAND OF
AOBA, NEW HEBRIDES.</div></div></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>To meet a burly native with elaborate ear-rings,
an ivory spike through his nose, and his face well
marked, with a collar and dickey hanging round his
neck, seems absolutely ridiculous, but the proud
possessor of such a costume will strut about as if he
were the best-dressed man in the islands. As may
be supposed they look particularly coy, some of
them, and only require a banjo and a pair of trousers
to make ideal Christy Minstrels. The humour of
their costumes, needless to say, does not strike
them, and their less-clothed neighbours look on
them with envy, whilst the girls bill and
coo at the <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span>
sight of them—such is fashion. A tappa loin-cloth,
similar to the Fijian cloth, was originally the fashion
amongst the women in parts of this group of islands,
prior to the coming of the white man, and it was
held round the waist by a belt of fibre and ornamented
with coloured or stained grass. But, back
in the bush, the married women were the only ones
who wore anything that could be really called a
costume, the younger women’s attire being only
flimsy grass mats made of streamers, and tied
round their waists—which from a point of decency
would be equal to a piece of mosquito netting.
The men were always clothed to a certain extent,
owing to a peculiar belief they hold that they must
not be seen naked.</p>

<p>Feathers play a prominent part in head dress on
special occasions, such as at the dance I have already
mentioned. The hair is never shaved off the men’s
heads but left to grow wild, and some of them
possess very fine beards and moustaches, but all
cannot boast such growth. I have seen a good few
with moustaches like boarding-house tooth-brushes.</p>

<p>Tattooing is not common, but cicatrices are,
and most men bear curious marks on their bodies.
These are made when they are quite young by
cutting a pattern on the skin
and then continually <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span>
removing the scab until a deep kind of scar is
formed. It takes a long time to become perfect,
but when it is they are exceedingly proud of it.</p>

<p>Paint is sometimes used for decorating their faces
and bodies in place of tattooing, but it is very ugly
and disfigures both the men and women. Red,
black, and white are the chief colours used, and
no particular design characterises the work; the
painter generally puts what his fancy suggests,
and no meaning is attached to it, as is generally the
case with the native markings.</p>

<p>The women are the workers here as elsewhere,
and at basket-making and mat-plaiting they are
splendid hands. Clothes used to be made by them
and bartered for food to villagers on the coast.
The mats are made from fibre, which in its turn
is made from the pandanus leaf by cutting it into
long shreds with a piece of shell and then allowing
it to dry. Most of the mats have some sort of a
pattern on them, and are now greatly prized by
collectors. In the New Hebrides they are put on
the floor of the huts, and are also used as screens to
cut off the sleeping apartments from the day room.
Some more artistic than others are fringed with
feathers or tassels of discoloured grass. These,
however, are generally made to sell
to the tourist. <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span></p>

<p>Baskets are also manufactured in some of the
islands. Pottery, however, is a forgotten art here,
and a legend accounting for the number of old and
broken pieces which may still be found in the bush
is worth relating.</p>

<p>The natives believe that their islands at one time
in the world’s history were brought up out of the
sea by a beautiful goddess, Li Maui Tukituki; they
say that when the world was quite new she was
carrying home some water in jars, but, owing to
the rocky state of the land she spilled the water,
which made her so angry that she threw the jars at
the ground and in that way punished it and made
it still. From that day to this it has not moved.
So tradition says, and these broken pieces of pottery
are known as the water jars of Li Maui Tukituki
and are held in great reverence by the natives.</p>

long voyages to trade with other islands, and, I
suppose, in the old days went hunting heads; some
of the canoes are made out of the trunks of the
bread-fruit trees. The poles supporting the outrigger
are run through holes in the side of the
canoe and lashed into position. There are no fine
lines in the curves of these boats, they are roughly
made and have very little decoration about them.
The outrigger itself is just a heavy log of wood
pointed at each end.</p>

<p>The sails of the larger boats are now made of
trade canvas, though they were originally made of
matting. The rowers or paddlers sit in the boat
upon the cross beams of the outrigger poles which
pass through the gunwale. The steersman sits
right aft, and can swing the boat round with
marvellous rapidity.</p>

<p>On Rano, a little island near Malekula, are three
or four very fine specimens of large war canoes
lying on the beach. I mention this, as it has been
said by many writers, who have visited these parts,
that the New Hebrides natives never possessed
large canoes, whereas these are far larger than any
in the Solomons, but, judging by their appearance,
they have not been in use for ages and ages, nor
can the natives there tell anything
of their history. <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span>
There is, of course, a possibility that they may
have been stranded there in a storm, but it is not
likely, as the stern of one of them is protected by
a shed, which looks as if it had always been its
resting-place, also, the whole construction is of the
Hebridean style. The larger of the two is considerably
over thirty feet from stem to stern, and
the bow rises up to a height of over ten feet, and is
made of a solid dug-out log curved and tapering
off to a point, where evidently a figure-head of
some sort has been, but now only a rudimentary
bird’s head remains, and suspended from the bird’s
neck are a pair of boar’s jaws.</p>

<p>The boat prow is ornamented and boxed and
laced with sinnet. The depth inside allows more
room than is usually found in like structures, and to
get this depth the sides have been built up by lacing
planks to each other in a curious and ingenious
way. The crew to man one of them must have
consisted of thirty or forty men at the very least.
The stem of the canoe is a high peaked one,
curving gently outwards and elaborately carved.</p>

<p>The outrigger is an enormous log, and is
attached in the ordinary way, though, of course,
owing to its great size, nearly a dozen pegs help to
keep the poles in position.</p>

<div class="dxxpn" id="p179">{179}</div>

<p>Though reliable information regarding these
relics cannot be obtained, it is evident that they
are highly prized, as periodically they are covered
with freshly fallen leaves to keep the sun from
warping them. They are evidently the last of
their kind, and show signs of having been occasionally
used as sailing canoes with a great mat sail,
probably after the style of the smaller craft of
similar construction often seen around Pentecost
Island. Rano Island, where these boats are, is a
pretty little place with a fine beach running up on
one side to a densely wooded shore. The village
lies back behind a line of scrub, and is completely
hidden from the view of the sea. This method of
building villages is common in the New Hebrides,
and is done to enable the inhabitants to get the
first sight of an attacking party.</p>

<p>The weapons of war used by these islanders
differ in many respects from those in the other
groups. Here the bow and arrow play a conspicuous
part in warfare and in hunting. The
bows are between six and eight feet long on some
islands, whilst at Malekula they are seldom more
than five feet; most of them are very roughly made,
neither the manufacturers nor owners seemed to
mind if the curve of the bow was
exact or not. <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span>
But in Malekula, again, both the workmanship and
artistic taste are more advanced.</p>

<p>The arrows are similar all over the group, and
measure about three feet in length; they come to
a sharp point at the end, which is charred to make
it harder. They are each composed of a piece of
hard wood pointed at the end, about a foot long,
let into a cane shaft and bound at the junction
with grass.</p>

<p>On Aoba Island the points of the arrows are
very long and are composed of sharpened human
bone. It was the custom in the old days to
poison the arrows before use, but what method
was adopted is not known, possibly they were
dipped in rotten fish or human flesh, the favourite
method of many savages.</p>

<p>The arrow used for fishing is a much longer one
and has three prongs, others of different design are
used for shooting birds.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>Fish, birds, and a few small animals form the only
wild diet for which hunting is necessary. Neither
lines nor hooks are used in the New Hebrides for
fishing, they scorn this method, in spite of the
demonstrations by the whites, and the greater
chance they would have of securing big catches.
Sometimes, however, they use a
small hand-net, but <span class="xxpn" id="p181">{181}</span>
only for small fish, and they are not keen on its use.
They stick to their spears, and as a rule they choose
a bright moonlight night when the tide is going out,
and armed with spears, bows and arrows, they crowd
down to the reefs with torches, and dart in and
out of the pools where fish are sure to be; then,
with a sharpness that is almost incredible, the
spears are seen to dart into the water, and come
out again an instant after with fine, struggling
fish on them. It is great sport, and there is little
wonder they enjoy it. Both sight and feeling are
brought into play during this pastime. The large
fish can be seen and are speared easily, but others
which just skim past the fisher’s legs are not as
quickly taken, and try the skill of the natives.
Others occasionally need a deal of chasing, for
once a native has felt his prey he will not rest until
he has secured it. He seems to be untiring, and
does not stop fishing until he has quite a good
haul.</p>

<p>Turtle fishing is not gone in for much, as the natives are
superstitious about the turtle, and civilisation has not yet been able
to dispel their fears. One of the chief ones is that the eggs are
sacred and may not be eaten. But one by one their superstitions are
going, for they see how the <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span>
white man prospers in spite of scorning all their sacred ideas, and
that now and then makes them courageous enough to break through the
barrier, and when once a superstition has been found untrue, they are
not slow in testing another, if by challenging it they can see any gain
for themselves.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3herein">CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<p class="psynopsis">The cultivation of copra—The labour traffic; when
slavery really existed, and the traffic in natives of to-day.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Copra is the staple industry of the New Hebrides,
as they say in the geography books, but the output of it is about
as reliable as the rainfall, for the supply depends not, as might
be expected, on the demand, but on the whim of the natives; if they
feel industrious, or are hard pressed for tobacco and provisions,
they will go into the bush and bring in a sufficient quantity to meet
their needs; but as a rule they will only collect it from their own
particular trees near their village and will not go far afield, where
they could get double the amount for half the labour.</p>

<p>Cocoa-nut palms grow in patches all over the
islands, and particularly along the coast, and they
make a charming picture viewed from the sea, with
their swaying trunks, and the quaint cluster of
leaves at the top: storm-tossed as they
are, owing to <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span>
being top-heavy, they all lean in one direction, the
way the wind blows strongest, and give the islands
a wild appearance. The rustle of their leaves as
one walks beneath them makes a strange noise,
and the falling of the nuts on a windy day is a
thing one has to be careful to avoid, as a good-sized
nut would seriously injure, if not kill, the
person on whom it fell.</p>

<p>I have seen a natural grove of these trees nearly
a mile long; the dark stems and sage-green leaves
against a blue sky, a bright yellow road underneath
which scintillated in the sun, and at its far
end was all blurred by the heat which rose as heat
does from a stove making everything quiver,
presenting a beautiful picture not easily forgotten.</p>

<p>All along the coast of Malekula and Tanna the
cocoa-nuts grow in abundance. At Samari, New
Guinea, there is one giant tree standing by two
others and away from the rest, the height of which
has been the means of many a sovereign changing
hands. For the first thing a new chum, fresh
trader, or captain is asked is to guess its height, and
few ever guess it correctly, for a more deceptive-looking
tree was never born. It grows just behind
the village and towers over everything, and is a landmark
that guides many a wanderer by
land and sea.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<div class="dxxpn" id="p185">{185}</div>

<p>The copra trade is of course carried on all over
these and the adjoining islands, but one sees more
of it going on in the New Hebrides than in the
Solomons or New Guinea.</p>

<p>Copra is the white of the cocoa-nut and is not
eaten by the natives at all; all they do with the
nuts is to drink the milk and use the fibre. Nearly
everything out there is made either of the leaves or
fibre, and even the trunks of the tree come in very
handy for manufacturing articles. When gathering
copra the natives scale the trees to get at the nuts,
and having collected a good supply they sit down,
break them open, and lay them out to dry in the
sun.</p>

<p>The oil of the cocoa-nut is chiefly made in
England and America, and the only process the
nut goes through in the islands is that of drying.
When the nuts have been collected they are split
in halves very carefully with an axe, and then the
halves are laid out in the sun. Very soon the heat
loosens the kernel, which comes away and is then
broken up into pieces. It is again put in the sun on
mats, where it remains until it is thoroughly dried;
then it is collected in sacks and sold by weight.
Some traders, however, go in for making cocoa-nut
oil, but not many, and if they do,
a different process <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span>
has to be gone through. The nut, instead of being
split open, has the husk cracked on a sharp pointed
stake, it is then torn off and the inside split in
two. Next the kernel is scraped out on an iron
scraper, which is attached to a stool on which the
native squats during the operation, and the white
part drops from the scraper into a vessel underneath,
and is then put into a cask to rot, after
which it is pounded and made into a pulp and
placed at the end of a tilted trough—a hollowed-out
log or old canoe—until all the oil runs out of
it. This oil is then strained and put into casks.</p>

<p>The stench of a copra boat is proverbial, and
this, without the copra bugs, is enough to make one
keep clear of them as much as possible. Each trader
has his copra shed and drying ground, and when
Burns Philp’s trading boats call, the sacks of copra
are taken out by the resident trader’s “boys” and
again sold, this time to be shipped home for further
handling. When the oil is extracted in England,
nearly double the quantity is obtained from the
same amount of nuts, and the refuse is made into
cakes for cattle.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>When the trading steamers come it is quite an
event in the monotonous life of many of the small
traders. Mails and provisions are
sought with an <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span>
eagerness that is delightful, for when a man has
talked nothing but native languages, and seen
nothing but black men for weeks, these visits are
naturally the important event, and a newspaper or
two, if such luxuries can be found, no matter how
old, are seized on by traders as if they were gold.</p>

<p>Copra is practically the only industry that
flourishes without artificial aid. Even that is now
being helped along, as the natives see there is
money in it, and some of the thrifty chiefs are making
their men plant the trees and look after them.</p>

<p>Traders and settlers now have plantations of
coffee, bananas, and a few other profitable products,
as I have already mentioned, and this industry is
beginning to be successful. Taros and yams are
cultivated by the natives, and require a good deal
of attention, and so nearly all the work is left to
the women. Yams vary from about the size of a
small marrow to a much larger affair. The “Chief’s
Yam” is pale pink in colour, and the ordinary ones
are like a white mealy potato. In taste they
resemble a cross between an artichoke and a potato.
Nearly all the villages possess a yam-house, which
is a sort of platform made of bamboo with a
thatched roof over it; the yams are hung from the
top or lie on the
platform to dry. <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span></p>

<p>There is a kind of arrowroot which grows wild
in the bush, besides a few other native vegetables,
but the latter are not of much account unless they
are cultivated.</p>

<p>The knowledge of agriculture learned by some
of the natives who have returned from Queensland
comes in useful. Sometimes evidences of it are to
be seen here and there, but it is a lamentable fact
that they do not make better use of their opportunities.</p>

<p>Whilst in Queensland they work well, especially
the women, and nowadays there is no difficulty
experienced in getting labour from these islands.
When the labour boat calls, the recruiting agent is
soon able to fill his vacancies, and the men he
brings back laden with goods make an excellent
bait for others.</p>

<p>When engaging the natives a small quantity of
money in advance is, I believe, paid to them as an
inducement to go, and then they sign on for two,
three, or more years to work at the Queensland
Sugar Refining Company’s places at Bundaberg,
Mackay, and elsewhere on the Queensland coast.</p>

<p>When there, they live chiefly in compounds,
and seem to enjoy the change of life. Their chief
duties are to cut the sugar-cane, stack
it, and put <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span>
it on the trolleys, which carry it to the refinery
works.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>The tremendous heat of these fields is beyond
description, owing to the number of the canes.</p>

<p>Many of the natives who have gone for a term
of three years become so fond of the life that
they remain on for much longer periods. Many
have been known to petition the Queensland
Government to be allowed to remain in the country
altogether. They mix up with natives from all
the islands, and intermarry in quite a friendly way.
If by chance a native of Malekula happened to
be left, on his return, in the Solomon islands by
mistake, he would probably be made into mincemeat:
but abroad they get on very well together.</p>

<p>The labour trade in New Guinea was stopped
some years ago, partly by Governor Macgregor,
and partly through the natives’ objection to work.
In this trait they resemble the Fijians, and consider
work is a form of slavery and so beneath them.</p>

<p>There is very little real affection between the
natives, they part from one another when going to
Queensland with hardly any show of regret. Sometimes
when a woman is going her companions cry,
but such scenes are exceptional.</p>

<p>On their return, however,
things are very <span class="xxpn" id="p190">{190}</span>
different, for they come laden with new and
interesting goods and money.</p>

<p>The chief immediately appropriates all the best
of these articles, and by so doing confers a great
honour on the home-comer. The returned one’s
relatives then swarm round him, and each takes
what he or she fancies; and the welcoming party,
consisting of fellow-tribesmen, receive their little
lot for having welcomed the returned one home.
The remainder of the goods are taken to their
owner’s shed, where they probably remain a few
days. Other claimants soon come forward, so
that in less than a week the hut is empty of all
save the worker and his three years’ experience.</p>

<p>In the old days the labour traffic, or “black
birding” as it was called, was one of the most disgraceful
trades ever carried on by British subjects.
So bad did it finally get that the Government
stepped in, and warships were kept on the lookout
for these slave-traders, and eventually, after a
lengthy period and, strange to say, much opposition,
the labour traffic was made into an honest business.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>The method adopted by the early kidnappers was to fit out a schooner
in Australia in much the same way as a slave-boat, with a large hold
arranged with tiers of platforms, on which the natives slept <span
class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span> at night. The owners would
start out, having secured orders from the Queensland sugar-planters for
so many natives at so much per head, and with these signed orders they
would visit the islands. At first some of them, according to reports,
did try persuasion, and even went so far as to barter with the chiefs
for a certain number of natives, but if this failed, as it often did,
they simply went ashore and carried off every man or woman they could
lay hold of, rowed them out to the ship, and then literally pitched
them into the hold. Others they would entice on board by offering to
give them presents, and when once on board they never saw the shore
again.</p>

<p>During the commission of inquiry into the ways
of these slave-dealers some ghastly facts were
brought to light, not only on the part of the dealers,
but also of the planters, particularly in Fiji where
many of the natives were sold. Here it came out
that two Englishmen, who were in the habit of
brutally ill-treating the natives, once overstepped
the mark by tying a woman to a tree and thrashing
her, and afterwards they rubbed the juice of
the Chili pepper into the wounds. This was quite
an ordinary form of punishment; but when they
cut the same woman’s toes off,
the natives banded <span class="xxpn" id="p192">{192}</span>
themselves together, burned down the whole plantation,
and killed the planters’ children. The two
planters, sad to relate, escaped.</p>

<p>But those days are passed now, and the planters
are very different men, and live their lives in peace
and tranquillity, and many of them treat the natives
so well that they will do
anything for them.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3herein">CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<p class="psynopsis">A short sketch of the missionary work in the South
Seas—Concerning John Williams, James Chalmers, and others.</p>

<p class="pfirst">I can do no better than conclude this short sketch of
the three most important groups of the South Sea islands by touching
on the work and lives of those brave fellows the missionaries, who
have left all the comforts of their English homes—their best friends
and everything else that was dear to them—to teach the gospel of their
Master and bring peace and happiness to these wild savages.</p>

<p>It is an easy thing to sneer at these “Gospel
punchers” as they are so often called “out west.”
But in spite of all the little things against them,
one cannot help asking: Is it not through the
work of the best of them that we are to-day able
to go amongst these savages?</p>

<p>The most bigoted unbeliever if he thinks, and
if he knows the sort of lives that many of these
pioneers have led, must
acknowledge their bravery, <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span>
even if he doubts their beneficial influence; but
only the most ignorant could do that.</p>

<p>Mercenary reasons have always been assigned
to account for the presence of the missionary in
savage lands and all over the world, and particularly
in New Zealand, one hears tales of the way the
early missionaries piled up the gold. In Australia
the same stories are told, but there was little in
these savage South Sea islands to attract the seeker
for gold at the time missionaries first began their
work, for whatever they made would be at such a
risk that it would not be worth their while.</p>

<p>In Australia and New Zealand, of course, there
is a difference, in the latter place particularly, for
there the Maoris were owners of large tracts of
valuable land, and, undoubtedly, one or two of the
lukewarm missionaries were tempted and fell.</p>

<p>One story I was told by an old Maori of a
certain missionary is worth relating, as his acts
rather upset the work of many honest men who
were really trying to do good to these noble
savages.</p>

<p>“Your clergyman be all right,” said the old
man, when I mentioned missionary work. “He
teach us about God, but He too greedy. He want
all
the Maori got.” <span class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span></p>

<p>“Nonsense,” I said; “who told you that
yarn?”</p>

<p>A smile went round the little crowd as the old
man glanced at his friends. “Mr. —— he told
us to look to God and we looked, while we
looked Mr. —— took our land. Then one day he
come to us and he say, ‘God wants more land,’ and
we gave him more land. Then some time soon he
came again and he say, ‘God wants cattle to put on
the land.’ And we give him cattle. Then he say,
‘God wants sheep.’ And we give him sheep.
Then long time after he come again and he say,
‘God want money to keep the cattle and the sheep.’
But we had no money and so we had no more
God.”</p>

<p>It is acts like these, committed by a few of
the black sheep, that have made the bushmen, the
cattlemen, and the traders sneer at the missionary,
and in their ignorance they have condemned the
whole for a part.</p>

<p>The trader and the kidnapper of the South Seas
have for years fought tooth and nail against the
missionaries, and it is they who have spread wild
tales of the misconduct and strange practices of
these noble men. They had an end in view, as they
knew their worst foe was not the
savage but the <span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span>
missionary; it is the missionary who has been the
means of stopping the ghastly trade in black men;
it is the missionary again who has seen that the
native was dealt with fairly; and these are the sins
he has committed and can never be forgiven.</p>

<p>As early as 1796 the London Missionary
Society, then the Missionary Society, undertook
the work of sending men to these islands in the
hope of winning their inhabitants to better lives.
At that time the lives they were living were as bad,
if not worse than those of savage beasts, and the
publication of Captain Cook’s <i>Voyages</i> in these
islands aroused men of Christian feeling, and was
the means of the Society sending out men to Tahiti;
most of whom eventually died of sickness or were
butchered by the natives.</p>

<p>For years these men and others worked their
hardest against fearful odds, and for ten years they
made little or no progress. Reports show that in
1813 one Tahitian had become a Christian. But
this was the beginning, and during the next few
years progress was as rapid as it had been slow
before. Eventually the king of the island acknowledged
the Christian belief, and set to work to
destroy the heathen gods.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>The adjacent islands were
next approached, and <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{197}</span>
the Tahitian Missionary Society was formed with
the avowed object of devoting all its energies to
the conversion of the natives of these islands.
Amongst its teachers the Society had a large body
of natives, and it was not only assisted in this
way but financially also by the very men who a few
years before would have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Then came one of the greatest of the great men
to these islands; John Williams, who was not only
a splendid worker but a magnificent organiser. He
soon had a boat fitted out in which he was able
to visit the adjoining islands; finally confining his
labours to New Guinea and the New Hebrides.</p>

<p>In 1823 Williams discovered Raratonga, an
island in the Hervey group, and he seems to have
devoted more of his time to the natives of this
island than any other. It was his island, “dear
Raratonga,” as he always called it. The population
of it when he landed he estimated as about 7000,
and in less than a dozen years he wrote of them in
the following <span class="nowrap">way:—</span></p>

<p>“I cannot forbear drawing a contrast between
the state of the inhabitants when I first visited
them, and now in 1834. In 1823 I found them all
heathens, in 1834 they were all professing Christians.
At the former period I found them
with idols and <span class="xxpn" id="p198">{198}</span>
Maraes; these in 1834 were destroyed, and in their
stead there were three spacious and substantial
places of Christian worship, in which congregations
amounting to 6000 persons assembled every
Sabbath day. I found them without a written
language, and left them reading in their own tongue
the wonderful works of God.”</p>

<p>And again he <span class="nowrap">said—</span></p>

<p>“In reference to the island generally, it may be
observed that the blessings conveyed to them by
Christianity have not been simply of a spiritual
character, but that civilisation and commerce have
invariably followed in her train.”</p>

<p>Succeeding this noble man in the islands were
men of fine characters, the Revs. William Gill,
E. W. Krause, and Messrs. Pitman and Buzacott,
and then in 1867 came the man whose sterling
good qualities will never be forgotten—James
Chalmers, or “Tamate,” the name by which he was
always known by the natives.</p>

<p>“Tamate” was bred and born in Scotland, and
it was there he grew muscular and learned to
love open-air life. Quite as a youth he became
enthusiastic to devote his life to missionary work in
savage lands; but subsequent events, and probably
his companions, who were young
men keen on <span class="xxpn" id="p199">{199}</span>
mischief and adventure, helped to make him forget
his early aspirations. In fact, in that splendid
biography of his written by Cuthbert Lennox, it is
stated that young Chalmers’ religious ideas went
through a period of uncertainty, and it was not
until 1859, when he was eighteen years of age,
that he had occasion to remember his early vow.</p>

<p>It was during a great religious revival, which was
bringing in thousands of converts in Scotland, that
Chalmers was persuaded to attend one of the meetings.
This meeting he himself said that he and
his friends had previously determined to do all in
their power to upset. The result of it was that
the true James Chalmers was roused, and from that
hour he never wavered in his determination to
teach the gospel to savages.</p>

<p>For years he worked steadily away at his studies, and in 1861 he
was appointed to a position in the Glasgow City Mission. His good
work brought him recognition, and finally he applied to the London
Missionary Society for a position as missionary. The application
was accepted, and Chalmers then went into training and was ordained
as a missionary in 1865. He sailed almost immediately afterwards in
the missionary boat <i>John Williams II.</i> for Raratonga island. <span
class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span></p>

<p>Prior to leaving England James Chalmers
married, and to his wife he gives the credit of half
the successes of his life. The passage out to the
South Seas was a terrible one, as the following
extract <span class="nowrap">shows:—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whilst still in the English Channel the vessel encountered
a terrific storm, memorable as being that in which
the <i>London</i> was lost. Three passengers were thrown out
of their bunks, the pilot was knocked insensible, the compass
binnacle was damaged, the whale-boat was carried away, and
the seamen were constrained to ask the missionaries to pray
for a change of wind. With difficulty the <i>John Williams II.</i>
made the Portland Roads, and escaped the fate of some
twenty-one vessels which foundered in the storm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this was only the beginning of the trials of
that journey. Another storm met them in the
Bay of Biscay, and a third one off the Cape of Good
Hope, but they reached Adelaide eventually, and
were there able to rest.</p>

<p>On the 21st of August the missionary ship which
was to carry them to the islands left Sydney, and was
in less than a fortnight high and dry on a reef, but
she did not become a total wreck. She was taken
back to Sydney for repair, leaving there again on
the 15th of November, to become a total wreck on
the 8th of January; her passengers were landed,
minus all their belongings, on
an almost unknown <span class="xxpn" id="p201">{201}</span>
and uninhabited island. The notorious <i>Bully
Hayes</i>, however, rescued them from this spot and
took them to Samoa. Eventually James Chalmers
and his wife reached Raratonga safely after a voyage
extending over seventeen months—the passage now
takes about six weeks.</p>

<p>“Tamate’s” life in the South Seas was a life of
sheer hard work, but he always felt, and properly so,
that he was making headway. At the beginning
of his career at Raratonga he set to work on the
young men, as he thought in them lay the future
hopes of the civilisation of the islands. When one
knows the risks he ran in going back into the bush,
where white men were so dreaded that they were
often shot on sight, one cannot help feeling that a
special providence was looking after him. He took
no half measures and made few concessions, but
went boldly to work at the start as he intended to
go on to the end.</p>

<p>Many of the natives had been in the habit
of fancying that the missionaries were weak
men, but in “Tamate” they met one who was
their equal in most things and could beat them at
many.</p>

<p>As a sportsman and a man of pluck he immediately
won their hearts, in fact
every one who <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
came in contact with him speaks of him as a Man
before all else.</p>

<p>One missionary said at the court in Sydney that,
in his dealings with the natives, he remembered
before all else that he was an Englishman, then a
man, and lastly a missionary; but in “Tamate”
every one recognised the Man.</p>

<p>From Raratonga Chalmers worked diligently
amongst all the adjacent islands, and when later he
had his yacht he was able to extend his operations
and win many of the worst savages to better ways,
and by joining in with the other missionaries some
splendid work was accomplished. Throughout he
saw the need of native teachers, and it was this
branch of the work he set himself to push on,
with the result that now there are native teachers
and preachers in every island in the Pacific.</p>

<p>The chief trouble with which he and other
missionaries had to contend was the climate; the
unhealthy districts they had to visit often laid them
up for weeks at a time. Finally Tamate’s wife,
after a long and distracting illness, died and left him
broken-hearted, for through all his difficulties she
had been his mainstay. She died at sea on the 25th
of October 1900. Her end was a very sad and
disappointing one, as is shown by
a letter Chalmers <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
wrote to one of his friends at the time. “We had
dreamt of a little rest together in a cottage out of
London somewhere, before we crossed the flood.
We shall dream no more, she waits on the other
side, as she said ‘I shall be waiting for you all.’”</p>

<p>It was not long she had to wait either, for on the
7th of April of the following year James Chalmers
was massacred in the Aird River district, a part of
the islands where he was not well known. The
following account of the massacre was written
by the Rev. A. E. Hunt, who accompanied His
Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony
on a punitive expedition. “The <i>Niue</i> (Chalmers’
yacht) anchored off Risk Point on the 7th of April,
and a crowd of natives came off. As it was near sunset
Tamate gave them some presents, and made signs
that they were to go away and the next day he
would visit them ashore. At daylight the next
morning a great crowd of natives came off and
crowded the vessel in every part. They refused to
leave, and in order to induce them to do so Tamate
gave Bob, the Captain, orders to give them presents.
Still they refused, and then Tamate said he would
go ashore with them, and he told Tomkins (his
right-hand man) to remain on board. The latter
declined and went ashore with
Tamate, followed by <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span>
a large number of canoes. When they got ashore
the whole party were massacred and their heads
cut off. The boat was smashed up, and the
clothing, etc., distributed. All the bodies were
distributed and eaten.”</p>

<p>Chalmers evidently felt that his end was coming,
though it cannot be supposed he knew how it
would come. A few weeks before his death he
wrote to a friend: “Time shortens, and I have
much to do. How grand it would be to sit down
in the midst of work and hear the Master say,
‘Your part is finished, Come.’”</p>

<p>Some time before Chalmers’ death Williams
and many other missionaries were massacred; in
fact it is in this way most of them have died, but
their work will always remain as a memento. As
Robert Louis Stevenson said, when bunching the
good and bad missionaries together:</p>

<p>“With all their gross blots, with all their deficiency of candour,
honour, and of common sense, the missionaries are the best and most
useful whites in the Pacific.”</p></div><!--section-->

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
